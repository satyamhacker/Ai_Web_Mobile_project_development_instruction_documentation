# Enterprise-Grade, AI-Friendly Backend Architecture Guidelines

## The Core Philosophy
This document outlines the strict architectural rules for building the backend (whether using NestJS, Django, Express, Spring Boot, etc.). The primary goal is **Extreme Isolation**. 

Currently, human developers act as orchestrators, while AI (LLMs) writes the code. Because of this, the architecture must be designed to accommodate the AI's constraints (context limits, hallucination risks) and strengths (laser-focused problem solving).

Tomorrow, if you ask an AI to fix a specific bug in "Payment Processing", you should only need to provide ONE exact file to the AI, completely eliminating the risk of the AI hallucinating and breaking the "User Registration" flow. 

**Rule of Thumb:** If an AI needs more than 3 files to fix a bug or add a minor feature, your files are too tightly coupled or too monolithic.

---

## 1. Micro-Modularization & Feature-Sliced Logic (Crucial)
Do not create monolithic Services, Controllers, or Views. A generic `UserService` or `MemberController` will quickly grow to 1000+ lines. When you feed a 1000-line file to an AI, token costs explode, and the AI loses focus, increasing the chance of collateral damage.

**The Solution: Use-Case Driven Files**
Break down large files into micro-features. Every file must handle only one specific business flow.
- ❌ **BAD:** `members.service.ts` (Handles registration, billing, attendance, emails)
- ✅ **GOOD:** 
  - `member-registration.service.ts`
  - `member-billing.service.ts`
  - `member-attendance.service.ts`
  - `member-notifications.service.ts`

**IMPORTANT FOLDER NAMING:** Always group these micro-files logically into cohesive sub-folders within the module (e.g., `modules/members/services/`, `modules/members/controllers/`).

## 2. Highly Descriptive, AI-Contextual Filenames & Module Prefixing
Rename all controllers, services, and models to be extremely descriptive based on exactly what they do, AND they must strictly begin with the module name as a prefix.
When you tag a file for AI context (e.g., `@[Filename]`), the AI should instantly know exactly what module it belongs to and what it does, even without seeing the folder path. Duplicate filename collisions are eliminated.
- ❌ **BAD:** `auth.py`, `utils.js`, `helpers.ts`, `SearchBar.tsx`
- ✅ **GOOD:** `billing-jwt-token-generator.utils.ts`, `billing-stripe-payment-webhook.controller.ts`, `attendance-member-registration-validator.py`
* **The Rule:** Every file name (not just the containing folder) MUST begin with the module name as a prefix. This applies to components, hooks, utils, types, constants, services, controllers — everything.
* **Component/Class Internal Naming:** The exported component, class, or function name inside the file MUST exactly match the filename (minus the extension) — no mismatches, no default-export-with-different-name. For example, `billing-invoice-generation.service.ts` must export `class BillingInvoiceGenerationService`. This prevents AI hallucination.

## 3. Strict Validation & DTO Isolation
Never mix data validation logic (checking if email is valid, password length) with business logic (saving to DB). 
Extract all validation logic (Zod schemas, Class-Validator DTOs, Django Forms/Serializers) into their own isolated files.
- **Why?** If the business logic is fine but the API is rejecting a payload, you only feed the AI `create-member.dto.ts`. The AI won't even see the database logic, guaranteeing 0% chance of breaking the database flow.

## 4. Interface & Type Isolation (The AI's Blueprint)
AI relies heavily on data shapes to write correct code. If the AI knows the exact shape of a `User` or a `PaymentPayload`, it doesn't need to see the database schema or the entire service file.
* **The Rule:** Extract all TypeScript `Interfaces`, `Types`, or Python `TypedDicts`/`Pydantic Models` into a dedicated `[module-name].interfaces.ts` file.
* **Why?** When you want the AI to write a new function, you just feed it the `interfaces` file. The AI instantly knows exactly what properties are available without having to read 500 lines of implementation code.

## 5. Centralized Constants (Single Source of Truth)
Find all hardcoded strings, error messages, magic numbers, and default config values scattered across your backend. Extract them into a module-level `[ModuleName].constants.ts` (or `.py`).
- ❌ **BAD:** `throw new Error("User age must be over 18")`
- ✅ **GOOD:** `throw new Error(MEMBER_ERRORS.AGE_RESTRICTION)`
- **Why?** Tomorrow, if the business requirement changes from 18 to 21, or if you need to translate error messages to a different language, you only feed the AI `members.constants.ts`. The business logic remains untouched.

## 6. Centralized Custom Exceptions
Handling errors with generic `throw new Error()` makes it hard for AI to write precise unit tests or generic error handlers.
* **The Rule:** Create specific exception classes in an `[module-name].exceptions.ts` file (e.g., `class InsufficientFundsException extends Error`).
* **Why?** If an AI is writing an Express error-handling middleware, providing the `exceptions.ts` file gives it a perfect, safe map of every possible error state it needs to catch and format for the frontend.

## 7. Isolated Database/Query Layer (The Repository Pattern)
Never write massive, complex raw SQL or 50-line ORM queries directly inside your business logic services.
Extract complex queries into a dedicated Repository or Query file (e.g., `member-analytics.repository.ts`).
* **The Rule:** If the backend is built using a JavaScript/TypeScript framework (NestJS, Express), you MUST use **TypeORM**. For other languages/frameworks (like Django), use the framework's native/standard ORM.
- **Why?** If the dashboard stats are calculating incorrectly, it's a database query issue. You provide the AI the `repository` file, not the `service` file.

---

## 8. Handling Edge Cases & Complex Scenarios

### Edge Case A: Cross-Module Dependencies (Tight Coupling)
*Scenario:* The `MemberRegistrationService` needs to trigger the `FinanceService` to generate an invoice, and the `EmailService` to send a welcome email. If they are tightly coupled, the AI will need all three files to understand the flow.
*Solution:* **Event-Driven Architecture (Pub/Sub).**
The `MemberRegistrationService` should only save the user and emit an event: `EventBus.emit('MEMBER_REGISTERED', user)`. The Finance and Email modules listen to this event independently. Now, the modules are 100% decoupled.

### Edge Case B: Database Transactions (All-or-Nothing Operations)
*Scenario:* You split your logic into `BillingService` and `MembershipService`. But creating a member and charging their card MUST happen in the same database transaction.
*Solution:* **Orchestrator Pattern.** 
Create a higher-level "Facade" or "Orchestrator" whose ONLY job is to open a transaction, call the micro-services passing the transaction object (`tx`), and commit/rollback. The micro-services themselves should remain pure and unaware of transaction boundaries.

### Edge Case C: Shared Utility Bloat (The "No Common Folder" Rule)
*Scenario:* Developers dump code into a global `utils/`, `common/`, or `shared/` folder to adhere to the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle. 
*Solution:* **WET over DRY for AI (Write Everything Twice).**
Strictly ban global `common/` or `shared/` folders. If a utility, enum, or type is used by the Finance module, put it in `modules/finance/utils/`. If the HR module needs the exact same utility, **duplicate the code** into `modules/hr/utils/`. 
* **Crucial Clarification (Domain vs Module):** WET duplication applies strictly at the **module level, not the domain level**. No shared folder is allowed at ANY level. Even if both the `billing` module and `attendance` module live under the same `erp` domain, they MUST get their own independent copies of a shared utility. There is no `erp/_shared/` folder.
* **Why?** In an AI-driven codebase, code repetition is entirely acceptable because AI writes the code. If we use a global `common/` folder, an AI might modify a shared function to fix a bug in HR, inadvertently breaking the Finance module. Complete module isolation guarantees 0% cross-module side effects.
* **Infrastructure Exception (Framework-Level vs Business-Logic-Level):** The WET-over-DRY / no-shared-folder rule applies strictly to **BUSINESS LOGIC utilities** (domain-specific helpers, formatters, validators). It does **NOT** apply to genuine framework-level infrastructure that every module is architecturally required to **extend OR consistently reference for correctness** (i.e., a single shared registry or config that MUST stay identical across all modules to function correctly — duplicating it would produce inconsistency, not isolation) — e.g. `BaseEntity` (Rule 58), the global `ResponseInterceptor` (Rule 28), `RolesGuard`/`@Roles()` decorator (Rule 83), the structured logger (Rule 14), `AsyncLocalStorage` context propagation (Rule 57), the centralized rate-limit tiers config (Rule 44), the event-registry constants (Rule 50), and the global database connection pool config (Rule 63). These live in a single, clearly-named `src/core/` or `src/infrastructure/` folder — **NOT** `src/shared/` or `src/common/` (to avoid becoming a dumping ground). This folder is intentionally small, framework-plumbing-only, and rarely touched — it does not carry the same "AI breaks module B while fixing module A" risk because it contains **no business logic**, only structural contracts that every module must extend or reference by architectural design.

### Edge Case D: External Service Adapters (Anti-Corruption Layer)
*Scenario:* When your backend talks to the outside world (Stripe, AWS S3, SendGrid), never put the `axios.post()` or SDK calls directly inside your business logic.
*Solution:* **Create an isolated wrapper or "Adapter"** for third-party tools (e.g., `stripe-payment.adapter.ts`). Your core service should only call generic methods like `paymentAdapter.charge()`.
* **Why?** If Stripe changes their API version, you only give the AI the `stripe-payment.adapter.ts` file. The AI fixes the API call without ever seeing (or risking breaking) your internal checkout logic.

## 9. Avoid Hardcoded HTTP Status Codes
Never hardcode HTTP status code numbers (e.g., `200`, `400`, `500`) in controllers, exceptions, or responses. 
* **The Rule:** Always use a framework-provided enum or a status code library (e.g., `HttpStatus` in NestJS, `http-status-codes` in Node, `rest_framework.status` in Django).
* **Testing Rule:** This applies strictly to E2E and Unit testing as well! In Python `pytest` suites, always use `from http import HTTPStatus` (e.g., `HTTPStatus.OK`, `HTTPStatus.CREATED`) rather than hardcoded integers.
* **Why?** It improves readability, prevents magic numbers, and reduces the risk of typos (e.g., typing `401` when you meant `403`).

## 10. Dynamic / Absolute Imports (No Hardcoded Relative Paths)
*(Applicable to JavaScript/TypeScript Frameworks)*
Never use fragile, hardcoded relative imports (e.g., `../../../utils/helpers`). 
* **The Rule:** Configure the backend framework to use absolute path aliases (e.g., mapping `@/` to the `src/` directory). Always use dynamic imports with `@/` (or your configured alias) instead of traversing directories up and down with `../..`.
* **Why?** It prevents import paths from breaking when files are refactored, moved, or copy-pasted, drastically improving the ability for AI to generate drop-in code without path hallucinations.

---

## How to Apply This to Different Frameworks

### In NestJS (TypeScript)
- Break down monolithic `@Injectable()` classes.
- Use `CQRS` (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) or just separate `xxx.service.ts` files.
- Put DTOs in a `dtos/` folder.
- Keep `@Controller()` classes incredibly thin; they should only receive the request and immediately pass it to a micro-service.

### In Django (Python)
- Avoid massive `views.py`. Create a `views/` folder and split class-based views into individual files (e.g., `member_registration_view.py`).
- Avoid "fat models". Move complex business logic from `models.py` into a `services/` directory.
- Keep `serializers.py` strictly for validation and data formatting.

### In Express.js (Node.js)
- Avoid putting logic inside route definitions.
- `routes/` should only map URLs to Controllers.
- `controllers/` handle HTTP (req, res).
- `services/` handle the heavy lifting and should be highly split up (e.g., `paymentService.js`, `refundService.js`).

## 11. Co-located Testing (Unit & E2E - Extreme Isolation)
Never put tests in a global `tests/` or `pytest_tests/` directory separate from the application code. 
* **The Rule:** Unit tests (`.spec.ts`) must live directly inside the module they are testing, adjacent to the micro-feature file (e.g., `member-registration.service.spec.ts` next to `member-registration.service.ts`). E2E / black-box API tests are written in Python pytest and live in a separate top-level `e2e/` directory (see Rule 27). Do NOT co-locate pytest files inside the NestJS module folders.
* **Why?** When an AI is asked to add a feature or fix a bug, providing the co-located `.spec.ts` file gives it complete unit-test context. The pytest E2E suite is decoupled from the Node.js runtime entirely.


## 12. Strict API Documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)
* **The Rule:** Every endpoint MUST be documented using the framework's native OpenAPI/Swagger tools (e.g., `@ApiTags` and `@ApiResponse` in NestJS, `drf-spectacular` in Django, or `swagger-jsdoc` in Express).
* **Why:** AI relies heavily on interface contracts. Keeping them mandatory and co-located with the controllers ensures frontend developers (and AI frontend agents) always have a mathematically accurate, up-to-date API contract to work with.

## 13. Environment & Configuration Management
* **The Rule:** Never use raw environment variables (e.g., `process.env.XXX` or `os.environ.get()`) directly inside business logic. Always use a centralized, strongly-typed Config Service or Settings class (e.g., `@nestjs/config` in NestJS, `settings.py` with `django-environ` in Django).
* **Why:** If the AI needs to add a new third-party API key or change a timeout value, it should only modify the central configuration schema, not hunt for raw env calls scattered across 50 different micro-services.

## 14. Standardized Logging & Correlation IDs (nestjs-pino & OpenTelemetry)
* **The Rule:** Never use raw print statements (e.g., `console.log()` or `print()`). The canonical logger for this NestJS project is **`nestjs-pino`** (wrapping `pino`). Do not use Winston or any other logger. 
* **The Log Structure:** Every log entry must automatically attach the current execution context. A standard log output must include:
  - `req` and `res` objects (for HTTP request tracking)
  - `trace_id` and `span_id` (injected via OpenTelemetry/AsyncLocalStorage)
  - `context` (e.g., the exact class or service name emitting the log)
  - `responseTime` (for access logs)
* **Why:** When logs are pushed to an aggregator like Datadog, ELK, or CloudWatch, developers can simply search for `trace_id="b8174fe8b671..."` to instantly pull up the exact journey of a request across 15 different micro-files. Standardized loggers also allow global turning on/off of debug statements and eliminate the need for manual ID passing.

## 15. Dependency Injection & Inversion of Control
* **The Rule:** Avoid instantiating complex service classes directly using `new MyService()` or `MyService()`. Rely on the framework's Dependency Injection system if it has one (NestJS, Spring Boot), or construct dependencies at the highest possible level (module/route boundaries) and pass them in.
* **Why:** AI might take shortcuts and manually instantiate classes inside business logic, creating tight coupling. Enforcing Dependency Injection ensures that tests can easily mock out databases, external APIs, and child services.

## 16. Module-Specific API Collections (Postman/Insomnia)
* **The Rule:** Whenever a module is created or finalized, generate a `[module-name]_collection.json` file directly inside the module's folder (e.g., `modules/auth/auth_collection.json`). 
* **Why:** This ensures that any developer (or human QA) can instantly import this JSON into Postman and manually test the module's endpoints without having to manually construct the headers, payloads, or figure out the routes. It provides immediate, highly-accessible testing verification.

## 17. Standardized Pagination, Sorting & Filtering (Enterprise Scale)
* **The Rule:** Any endpoint that returns tabular or list data (e.g., Orders, Members) MUST ALWAYS support pagination, sorting (e.g., `sortOrder=ASC/DESC`), and filtering (e.g., `startDate`, `endDate`, `search`). Never return raw, unpaginated lists if the dataset can grow large.
* **Implementation:** Always use a standardized wrapper or query DTO (e.g., `limit/offset` based pagination extended with filtering/sorting properties) across all controllers.
* **Why:** Returning thousands of unfiltered rows crashes browsers. If the AI is asked to add an endpoint for `MemberAnalytics` or `Orders`, it must proactively build in sorting and date filtering capabilities so the frontend can display robust table controls.

## 18. Strict ES Modules (No `require`)
*(Applicable to JavaScript/TypeScript Frameworks)*
* **The Rule:** Never use the `require()` keyword. It is considered dead/legacy in this architecture. You must exclusively use ES module `import` and `export` statements.
* **Why:** ES Modules are the modern standard, they provide strict typing compatibility out of the box in TypeScript, support better static analysis/tree-shaking, and ensure consistent import syntax across the entire codebase.

## 19. Module-Level Feature Documentation
*(Crucial for AI Context & Onboarding)*
* **The Rule:** Every single module must contain a `[module_name]_backend_feature.md` file at its root (e.g., `modules/auth/auth_backend_feature.md`). 
* **Why:** Before an AI or a new human developer makes any changes to a module, they will read this file first. It acts as the ultimate localized context guide, instantly explaining the routing, file responsibilities, and logic, drastically reducing the risk of hallucination or breaking existing architecture.

### Documentation Quality Standard

**The purpose of `_backend_feature.md` is that an AI given ONLY that file + the module folder can fully understand, modify, or debug the module without reading anything else. Generic boilerplate defeats this entirely.**

#### ❌ BAD — What AI agents produce without quality enforcement:
```markdown
## Module Purpose
Handles billing operations.

## Feature Inventory
| POST /billing/charge | /billing/charge | Handles charging | CreateChargeDto |

## Edge Cases / AI Warnings
- TBD
- Do not bypass the Orchestrator.
```
*Why this fails: "Handles billing operations" tells an AI nothing. "TBD" is worse than no doc. "Do not bypass the Orchestrator" with no context is unactionable.*

#### ✅ GOOD — What every `_backend_feature.md` must look like:
```markdown
## Module Purpose
Processes all wallet top-ups, plan purchases, and refunds for gym members.
Wallet balance is stored in paise (integer). All mutations go through
BillingOrchestratorService to guarantee atomic DB + audit log writes.
Never call BillingWalletRepository directly from outside this module.

## Feature Inventory
| POST /billing/wallet/topup | WalletCommandController | Top up member wallet | WalletTopupDto |
| POST /billing/plans/purchase | PlanCommandController | Purchase a plan | PlanPurchaseDto |

## Edge Cases / AI Warnings
- Wallet deductions use pessimistic locking (Rule 41) — never remove the
  SELECT FOR UPDATE or concurrent requests will produce negative balances.
- Plan purchase and wallet deduction MUST be in the same transaction
  (BillingOrchestratorService) — splitting them causes partial charge bugs.
- Idempotency-Key header is mandatory on /wallet/topup (Rule 31) —
  removing it will cause double-charges on network retries.
```
*Why this works: An AI can read this and immediately know the invariants, the danger zones, and exactly which rules apply — without reading a single source file.*

**Failure Conditions — A `_backend_feature.md` FAILS quality review if it contains:**
- Any section with "TBD" or "N/A" as the entire content
- Module Purpose under 3 sentences
- Edge Cases with fewer than 3 concrete, module-specific entries
- Generic warnings not tied to a specific rule number (e.g., "be careful with transactions" with no Rule citation)
- Feature Inventory rows where Purpose column is just "Handles X"

**Documentation Freshness Rule:** `_backend_feature.md` MUST be updated in the same commit as any code change to the module. A stale feature doc is worse than no doc — it actively misleads AI agents.

---

### Mandatory `[module_name]_backend_feature.md` Template
Every backend module MUST use this minimum structure:

```markdown
# [Module Name] Backend Feature Map

## Module Purpose
[REQUIRED: 3+ sentences. What business problem does this module solve? What are
the key invariants (e.g., "all mutations go through the Orchestrator")? What
should an AI NEVER do in this module?]

## Directory Structure
| File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| [module]-command.controller.ts | [REQUIRED: exact HTTP mutations it handles] |
| [module]-query.controller.ts | [REQUIRED: exact read endpoints it handles] |
| services/[module]-orchestrator.service.ts | [REQUIRED: what it orchestrates] |
| repositories/[module].repository.ts | [REQUIRED: what queries it owns] |
| dtos/[module]-create.dto.ts | [REQUIRED: what it validates] |
| [module].entity.ts | [REQUIRED: what DB table it maps to] |

## Feature Inventory
[REQUIRED: One row per endpoint. Purpose must be a full sentence, not "Handles X".]
| Controller/Endpoint | HTTP | Path | Purpose | Request DTO | Response DTO |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Data and State Architecture
[REQUIRED: Fill every field. Write "none" only if genuinely none.]
- DB Entities: [entity names and their table names]
- Redis Caching Keys: [key patterns and TTLs, e.g., `billing:wallet:{memberId}` TTL 5min]
- Event Emitters: [event names from event-registry.constants.ts, e.g., BILLING.PAYMENT.FAILED]
- Background Jobs: [queue names and what triggers them]
- Idempotency Keys: [which endpoints require Idempotency-Key header — Rule 31]

## Business Flow / Key Sequences
[REQUIRED: For each non-trivial mutation, describe the exact execution chain.]
**Example — Plan Purchase:**
1. PlanCommandController receives POST /billing/plans/purchase
2. Validates PlanPurchaseDto (Rule 3)
3. Calls BillingOrchestratorService.purchasePlan(dto)
4. Orchestrator opens DB transaction
5. Calls BillingWalletRepository.deductBalance() with pessimistic lock (Rule 41)
6. Calls MemberPlanRepository.createPlanRecord()
7. Commits transaction — emits BILLING.PLAN.PURCHASED event
8. EventBus listener triggers NotificationService (decoupled — Rule 8A)

## File Responsibility Map
[REQUIRED: One line per file stating its single responsibility and what it must NOT do.]
- `billing-orchestrator.service.ts` — Opens transactions, calls micro-services. MUST NOT contain business logic.
- `billing-wallet.repository.ts` — Raw DB queries for wallet table only. MUST NOT call other repositories.
- `billing-plan-purchase.service.ts` — Plan purchase business logic only. MUST NOT touch wallet directly.

## Permissions and Security
[REQUIRED: List every endpoint with its required role(s) and any resource-level checks.]
| Endpoint | Required Role(s) | Resource-Level Check |
|---|---|---|
| POST /billing/wallet/topup | MANAGER, ADMIN | Actor must belong to same branch as member |
| GET /billing/history | MANAGER, ADMIN, MEMBER | Member can only see own history |

CODEOWNERS path: `src/modules/[domain]/[module]/` → @[reviewer-handle]

## Edge Cases / AI Warnings
[REQUIRED: Minimum 3 entries. Each must cite a specific Rule number and explain
the exact consequence of violating it — not just "be careful".]
- [Specific invariant]: [What breaks if violated] — see Rule [N]
- [Concurrency risk]: [Race condition scenario] — requires pessimistic lock (Rule 41)
- [Transaction boundary]: [What must be atomic and why] — see Rule 8B

```

## 20. Performance & Network Optimization (Compression, Rate Limiting & Caching)
* **The Rule:** Enterprise APIs must protect their bandwidth and server load. 
  1. **Rate Limiting / Redis:** Implement strict rate limiters on all public endpoints (especially Auth and generic GET routes). Use Redis (or similar caching layers like Memcached) to handle rate limiting and to cache expensive, frequently requested data.
  2. **Response Compression:** Enable gzip/Brotli compression at the framework level (e.g., `compression` middleware in Node.js, `GZipMiddleware` in Django, or `server.compression.enabled` in Spring Boot) to drastically reduce JSON response sizes and save bandwidth.
* **Why:** This ensures the backend remains highly available under load and saves massive amounts of egress bandwidth costs.

## 21. Asset Optimization (The WebP Rule)
* **The Rule:** Never store unoptimized images (like `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.bmp`) on the server disk or cloud storage. When an image is uploaded (e.g., a member profile picture), it must immediately be processed, compressed, and converted to `.webp` format before saving.
* **Why:** WebP reduces image file sizes by up to 80% compared to JPEG/PNG without visible quality loss. This drastically reduces cloud storage costs and speeds up frontend loading times, resulting in a much faster app.

## 22. Security Headers, CORS, & Protection
* **The Rule:** An enterprise app cannot go to production naked. Always implement security middleware (e.g., `Helmet.js` in Node, `SecurityMiddleware` in Django, or `Spring Security`) to set strict HTTP headers. Configure strict CORS policies (only allowing exact frontend domains). Ensure inputs are stripped of executable scripts (XSS protection) and standard ORMs are used to natively prevent SQL injection.

## 23. Background Jobs & Queues (No Hanging Requests)
* **The Rule:** An HTTP request should respond in under 500ms. If a user triggers a heavy task (e.g., "Send 1,000 promotional emails", "Generate a 50-page PDF report", "Process a video"), DO NOT process it in the main HTTP thread.
* **Why:** Use a Message Queue or Task Broker (e.g., BullMQ for Node, Celery for Python/Django, or Spring AMQP/RabbitMQ). The controller should immediately return `202 Accepted: Job Started`, and the background worker handles the heavy lifting safely. This prevents server timeouts and crashed requests.

## 24. Database Migrations (No Auto-Syncing & Backward Compatibility)
* **The Rule:** In development, auto-syncing tools (like TypeORM's `synchronize: true` or Hibernate's `update`) are fine. But in an enterprise environment, database schemas must be strictly version-controlled using **Migrations** (e.g., Django `makemigrations`, Flyway/Liquibase for Java, Alembic for Python). 
* **Backward Compatibility Requirement:** Existing v1 clients must be supported during DB migrations. Migrations must be strictly backward-compatible. Never drop a column in the same migration that adds a `NOT NULL` replacement. Do it in two phases. Avoid single-step destructive migrations.
* **Why:** If the AI needs to add a new column to a table, it should generate a explicit migration file. This guarantees that production databases can be safely upgraded (or rolled back) without data loss or rogue schema syncing breaking the app, and ensures no downtime for legacy clients.

## 25. Graceful Shutdown & Health Probes (Kubernetes/Docker Ready)
* **The Rule:** Enterprise apps are deployed in containers. You must include a `/health` or `/ping` endpoint for Kubernetes/AWS liveness probes. Furthermore, the application must intercept termination signals (`SIGINT`, `SIGTERM`).
* **Why:** When a server restarts or a container is killed, it shouldn't just die instantly, dropping user requests mid-flight. It must stop accepting new requests, finish processing current ones, safely close the database connection, and *then* shut down.

## 26. API Versioning (URI Based)
* **The Rule:** An enterprise API must never be released without a versioning strategy. Always prefix routes with a version (e.g., `/api/v1/users`). In frameworks like NestJS, enable URI versioning globally.
* **Why:** If the business scales and requires mobile apps or external integrations, releasing a breaking `v2` API should not crash the legacy mobile apps that still rely on `v1`.

## 27. API Testing Strategy (Two-Tier: Jest Unit + Pytest E2E)
* **The Rule:** This project uses a strict two-tier testing strategy:
  1. **Jest `.spec.ts` (Unit Tests):** Co-located with source files (see Rule 11). Tests individual service methods, DTOs, and utilities in isolation with mocked dependencies. This is the AI's primary safety net when modifying a micro-file.
  2. **Python `pytest` (Black-Box E2E / API Tests):** Lives in a top-level `e2e/` directory, completely decoupled from the Node.js runtime. Tests the running API as a true external client — no knowledge of internal implementation. QA engineers and CI pipelines use this tier.
* **Strict Boundary:** Jest is NEVER used for API/E2E testing. Pytest is NEVER used for unit testing internal service logic. These two tiers must never overlap.

## Summary Checklist for Developers Providing Context to AI:
1. Identify the exact layer where the bug/feature resides (Validation? DB Query? Business Logic?).
2. Select the **one or two** micro-files associated with that layer.
3. Pass ONLY those files to the AI.
4. Review the AI's isolated changes.

## 28. Standardized Response Envelope (The API Contract)
* **The Rule:** Every API endpoint — success or failure — must return a response in a single, predictable JSON "envelope" shape. Never return raw objects, raw arrays, or ad-hoc structures directly from controllers. Both Success and Error responses must share the EXACT SAME canonical type definition.
* **The Shared Canonical Shape (Frontend & Backend):**
  ```typescript
  {
    success: boolean;
    message: string;
    data: T | null;
    meta?: PaginationMeta;
    error?: string;
    statusCode?: number;
  }
  ```
* **Implement via:** A global `ResponseInterceptor` (NestJS), `APIView` / custom `Renderer` (Django), or a `res.success()` helper (Express). The AI should NEVER shape the raw response manually inside a controller or service.
* **Why:** When an AI frontend agent hits an API, it needs a predictable contract. If success and error payloads have totally different shapes, the frontend's generic `ApiResponse<T>` parser becomes brittle. A singular standard envelope eliminates all ambiguity.

---

## 29. Soft Deletes (Never Hard-Delete Production Data)
* **The Rule:** Never use destructive `DELETE` SQL / ORM calls directly on production data. Instead, all entities must have an `is_deleted: boolean` (or `deleted_at: timestamp`) column. A "delete" operation only sets this flag — the data is never physically removed.
* **Why:**
  1. **Audit & Recovery:** If an admin accidentally deletes 1,000 members, the data is instantly recoverable.
  2. **Referential Integrity:** Foreign keys referencing a "deleted" record remain valid, preventing cascade failures.
  3. **AI Safety:** An AI asked to "implement the delete endpoint" will set a flag, not wipe database rows. This prevents catastrophic, irreversible data loss.
* **Implementation:** Add a global query filter (e.g., TypeORM's `@DeleteDateColumn`, Django's `django-softdelete`, or a `WHERE is_deleted = false` scope in a base repository class) so that all standard `find` queries automatically exclude soft-deleted records.

---

## 30. Audit Trail / Activity Log (Who Did What & When)
* **The Rule:** Every meaningful state change to critical entities (Members, Payments, Staff, Settings) MUST be recorded in an `audit_logs` table. At minimum, log: `actor_id`, `actor_role`, `action` (e.g., `MEMBER_UPDATED`), `entity_type`, `entity_id`, `old_value` (JSON), `new_value` (JSON), `ip_address`, `timestamp`.
* **How:** Implement this as a cross-cutting concern using:
  - **NestJS/Express:** An interceptor or middleware that fires an event after mutating requests.
  - **Django:** Model `post_save` / `post_delete` signals.
  - **Spring Boot:** AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) with `@AfterReturning` advice.
* **Why:** Regulators, auditors, and enterprise clients will always ask "who changed this record and when?". Building this from day one costs almost nothing. Retrofitting it onto a live production system costs weeks. It also gives AI agents an immutable history to reason about when debugging.

---

## 31. Idempotency Keys for Critical Mutations
* **The Rule:** Any endpoint that triggers a financial transaction, sends a communication, or creates a resource that must never be duplicated MUST support an `Idempotency-Key` request header. The server caches the result of the first request with that key. If the same key is received again (e.g., due to a network retry), it returns the original cached result without re-executing the operation.
* **Why:** Networks are unreliable. A client (mobile app, frontend, partner API) might retry a `POST /payments` request after a timeout, not knowing the first one succeeded. Without idempotency, the member gets double-charged. This is a critical rule for any fintech or e-commerce feature.
* **Implementation:** Store `(idempotency_key, response_payload)` in Redis with a TTL of 24 hours. Check before processing. Return cached response if key already exists.

---

## 32. Observability: The Three Pillars (Logs, Metrics, Traces)
* **The Rule:** Logging alone is not sufficient for enterprise observability. You MUST implement all three pillars:
  1. **Structured Logs** (Rule 14): Already covered. Use JSON-formatted logs.
  2. **Metrics:** Expose a `/metrics` endpoint (Prometheus format) tracking: request count, request latency histograms, error rates, queue depth, DB connection pool usage. Use libraries like `prom-client` (Node), `django-prometheus` (Django), or Spring Boot Actuator.
  3. **Distributed Traces:** Integrate OpenTelemetry to trace a single request as it flows through controllers → services → repositories → external APIs. Each span should include `correlation_id`, `duration_ms`, and `status`.
* **Why:** When a production request is slow or fails silently, logs tell you WHAT happened, metrics tell you HOW OFTEN it happened, and traces tell you EXACTLY WHERE the bottleneck is. An AI debugging agent with access to all three can diagnose issues orders of magnitude faster.

---

## 33. Secret Management (Never Trust `.env` Files in Production)
* **The Rule:** `.env` files are acceptable in local development ONLY. In staging and production environments, secrets (API keys, DB passwords, JWT secrets) MUST be injected from a dedicated secrets manager:
  - **AWS:** AWS Secrets Manager or Parameter Store
  - **GCP:** Google Secret Manager
  - **Azure:** Azure Key Vault
  - **Self-hosted:** HashiCorp Vault
* **Rules:**
  1. `.env` files must NEVER be committed to source control (enforce with `.gitignore`).
  2. The application must fail fast on startup with a clear error if a required secret is missing.
  3. Secrets must be rotated regularly. The application should support hot-reloading of secrets without a restart.
* **Why:** A leaked `.env` file on GitHub has caused catastrophic security breaches for companies. An AI writing deployment configs must be instructed to always reference the secrets manager, never hardcode credentials.

---

## 34. Database Query Optimization (The N+1 Rule & Index Strategy)
* **The Rule:** The single most common performance killer in any ORM-backed backend is the N+1 query problem. You must proactively prevent it.
  1. **N+1 Prevention:** Always use eager loading / `JOIN` fetching when you know you'll need related data (e.g., `prefetch_related` in Django, `relations` in TypeORM, `@EntityGraph` in JPA). Never fetch a list of 100 members and then loop to fetch each one's plan separately.
  2. **Index Strategy:** Every foreign key column, every column used in a `WHERE` clause, and every column used in an `ORDER BY` clause MUST have a database index. Indexes should be explicitly defined in migration files — never rely on the ORM to create them automatically.
  3. **Slow Query Logging:** Enable slow query logging in the database (queries > 100ms). Review this log weekly.
* **Why:** An AI asked to write a "Get all members with their plans" repository method will often produce an N+1 query by default. This rule forces a review gate.

---

## 35. GDPR & Data Privacy by Design
* **The Rule:** Data privacy is not a feature — it is a foundation. Implement the following from day one:
  1. **Data Minimization:** Only collect data you absolutely need. Never store sensitive fields (passwords, card numbers) in plaintext. Always hash passwords (bcrypt/argon2) and tokenize payment data.
  2. **Right to Erasure:** The "delete account" flow must be able to fully anonymize or purge a user's PII (Personally Identifiable Information) from all tables, logs, and caches on demand. (Works hand-in-hand with Soft Deletes — Rule 29).
  3. **Data Retention Policy:** Old logs, inactive accounts, and historical records must be automatically purged after a defined retention period (e.g., 3 years). Implement a scheduled background job for this.
  4. **Sensitive Field Masking in Logs:** Never log raw PII. Phone numbers, emails, and names in log lines must be partially masked (e.g., `r***@gmail.com`).
* **Why:** GDPR violations can result in fines up to 4% of global annual revenue. An AI writing a logging statement must be aware it cannot log raw user data.

---

## 36. Defensive Programming & Fail-Fast Principle
* **The Rule:** Never assume inputs are valid at any layer. Every function, service method, and repository call must validate its inputs and fail immediately and loudly if assumptions are violated — rather than silently producing corrupt data downstream.
  - **At the Controller layer:** Validate request shape with DTOs/serializers (Rule 3).
  - **At the Service layer:** Assert that objects received from repositories are not null before operating on them. If a `findById` returns `null`, throw the appropriate custom exception immediately (Rule 6) — don't pass `null` to the next function.
  - **At the Database layer:** Enforce data integrity constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK constraints, foreign keys) at the database level. Never rely solely on application-level validation.
  - **Critical Operations (Transactions, External APIs, Queues):** Any operation that interacts with unpredictable systems or requires all-or-nothing execution MUST be wrapped in a `try-catch` block.
    1. **Database Transactions:** If a multi-step mutation (e.g., creating a user and charging their card) fails, the `catch` block MUST explicitly rollback the transaction to prevent corrupted, partial data states.
    2. **Debugging & Traceability:** The `catch` block MUST log the exact error using the centralized logger (which automatically attaches the `trace_id`) before returning a controlled error to the frontend. This ensures immediate, pinpoint debugging when transactions or external services fail.
* **Why:** Silent failures are the hardest bugs to find and the most dangerous in production. An AI writing a service method that receives a `null` user and calls `user.email` will produce a `NullPointerException` / `AttributeError` that crashes the request. The Fail-Fast principle ensures errors surface immediately at their origin, with a clear, actionable error message, not silently 10 layers later.


---

## 37. Strict Edge Payload Validation (No Mass Assignment)
* **The Rule:** It is not enough to just validate that `email` and `password` exist in a DTO. Your payload validator MUST strictly strip or reject any unrecognized properties sent by the client. (e.g., in NestJS: `whitelist: true, forbidNonWhitelisted: true`). Additionally, enforce a **default global JSON payload size limit of `1mb`** at the framework middleware level. Individual endpoints that require larger payloads (e.g., file uploads) must explicitly override this limit per-endpoint (see Rule 72).
* **Why:** If a malicious user sends `{ "email": "test@test.com", "role": "admin" }` to the registration endpoint, and you blindly pass the `req.body` to the ORM's save method, you have a Mass Assignment vulnerability. Stripping unknown keys guarantees this is mathematically impossible.

---

## 38. Domain-Driven Module Grouping (The "Route Group" Equivalent)
* **The Rule:** Just like modern frontend frameworks (e.g., Next.js) use `(group)` folders to isolate UI domains like `(erp)` or `(superadmin)`, the backend MUST group its modules into top-level domain folders before splitting them into specific features.
  - ❌ **BAD:** `src/modules/billing/`, `src/modules/superadmin-stats/`, `src/modules/attendance/` (All dumped into a flat `modules/` directory).
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `src/modules/erp/billing/`, `src/modules/superadmin/stats/`, `src/modules/members-app/attendance/`.
* **Frontend-First Naming Lock:** Since this project follows a frontend-first workflow (UI built with mock data before backend), the frontend feature folder names are the canonical source of truth. When backend development begins, the backend AI/developer MUST reuse the EXACT same folder/module name as the frontend. Renaming a feature during backend development is strictly forbidden without updating the frontend folder to match first.
* **Casing Translation Rule:** The semantic name stays identical across frontend/backend; only the casing style changes per language/framework convention (e.g., frontend `auth` folder → backend `auth/` folder with `AuthModule` classes — never changing to a different semantic word like `identity`).
* **API Route Grouping & Mirroring:** The API endpoint URLs must strictly mirror this domain grouping (e.g., `/api/erp/billing`, `/api/superadmin/stats`). Furthermore, page-to-endpoint naming must mirror exactly: if the frontend `/auth/` module calls an API, the route MUST be `/api/v1/auth/...`, not `/api/v1/session/...`. This ensures the debugging flow from UI page -> Frontend Folder -> Backend Folder -> Backend Route is 100% identically named.
* **1:1 Mirror Mapping:** The backend folder structure MUST strictly mirror the frontend route structure. If the frontend `(superadmin)` domain has 5 feature folders (e.g., `broadcasts`, `coupons`, `affiliates`), the backend `superadmin` domain MUST have exactly 5 matching modules. 
* **Why:** This creates a perfect 1:1 mapped architecture. If a bug occurs in the "Coupons" feature, you provide the AI with exactly two things: `frontend/.../superadmin/coupons/` and `backend/.../superadmin/coupons/`. The AI gets the complete vertical slice (Frontend UI + Backend Logic) for that specific feature without seeing the rest of the application. This guarantees zero hallucination, massive token savings, and perfect separation of concerns.

---

## 39. True Multi-Tenancy (Database-per-Tenant Architecture)
* **The Rule:** The application MUST be built using a strict **Database-per-Tenant** architecture to guarantee absolute data isolation, high performance, and security. It is unacceptable to dump all gyms or whatever the project is ' data into a single database with a `tenant_id` column (row-level multi-tenancy).
* **Architecture Strategy:**
  1. **Master Database:** A central database (e.g., `gymsmart_master`) must exist solely to manage global resources: Users, Authentication, Tenants (Gyms), Subscriptions, and Feature Flags.
  2. **Tenant Databases:** Every time a new gym registers, the backend must programmatically create a brand-new database (e.g., `tenant_db_101`) and run all schema migrations on it automatically. *(Note: All these logical databases reside within the same single MySQL/PostgreSQL server instance; do not spin up new physical servers/VPS per tenant).*
  3. **Dynamic Connection Routing (Request Scoped):** The backend must intercept every incoming API request. Using a global middleware or interceptor, it must extract the `x-tenant-id` (from HTTP headers or JWT payload) and dynamically construct or switch the database connection to point to that specific tenant's database for the lifecycle of that request. **⚠️ See Rule 63 before implementing this** — the connection pool budget must be calculated across ALL active tenant DataSources combined, not per-tenant. Blindly applying `max: 20` per tenant DataSource will exhaust the database server's connection limit under load.
* **How to Apply to Different Frameworks:**
  - **NestJS (Node/TypeScript):** Do not use a static `TypeOrmModule.forRoot`. Use request-scoped providers or custom connection factories that cache and resolve `DataSource` instances based on the request's tenant header.
  - **Django (Python):** Use database routers (`db_for_read`, `db_for_write`) paired with thread-local storage or middleware to dynamically route queries to the correct database alias based on the request.
  - **Spring Boot (Java):** Implement `AbstractRoutingDataSource` and use a `ThreadLocal` context holder populated via a HandlerInterceptor to route database connections dynamically.
* **Why:** If Gym A and Gym B share the same database tables, a single missing `WHERE tenant_id = X` clause in a business query results in a catastrophic cross-tenant data breach. Database-per-tenant completely eliminates this risk at the infrastructure level. Furthermore, queries are infinitely faster because a table only contains the data of one specific gym, avoiding massive billion-row bottlenecks.

---

## 40. Multi-Medium Sending Architecture (Proof of Delivery)
* **The Rule:** Whenever the system needs to send something to a user as a proof of transaction (e.g., a bill, a receipt, a report, or an alert), the backend MUST architect the payload and services to support at least **two different mediums** (e.g., WhatsApp and Email, or SMS and Email).
* **Mandatory Fallback:** One of the two mediums must always be configured as the mandatory fallback or default. The backend API should accept an explicit `deliveryMedium` parameter (e.g., `WHATSAPP` or `EMAIL`) from the frontend payload and route the message via the chosen service.
* **Why:** This ensures that if one provider fails or a user doesn't have WhatsApp, they can still receive critical proofs via Email or another backup medium.

---

## 41. Transaction Locks & Race Condition Prevention
* **The Rule:** For highly concurrent mutations (e.g., deducting wallet balances, booking limited seats, processing inventory), standard database transactions are not enough to prevent race conditions. You MUST implement **Pessimistic Locking** (e.g., `SELECT ... FOR UPDATE` via `QueryBuilder.setLock('pessimistic_write')` in TypeORM or `select_for_update()` in Django) or **Optimistic Locking** (using a `@VersionColumn`).
* **Why:** If two concurrent requests try to deduct money at the exact same millisecond, a standard transaction might allow both to succeed based on stale read data, causing negative balances. Enforcing this rule ensures AI always explicitly handles concurrency.

---

## 42. Distributed Cron Jobs (No Local Schedulers)
* **The Rule:** Never use local cron jobs (like `setInterval`, `node-cron`, or `@Cron()` without a lock) inside the backend code. You must use a **Distributed Task Scheduler** backed by Redis (like BullMQ in Node, Celery Beat in Python) or a database-backed distributed lock (like Redlock/ShedLock).
* **Why:** In an enterprise environment, your backend will scale horizontally (e.g., 3 instances running behind a load balancer). If you use a local cron job to send "Morning Reminders", all 3 instances will fire it simultaneously, sending 3 duplicate emails to the user. A distributed scheduler guarantees a job only runs exactly once across the entire cluster.

---

## 43. True E2E Test Database Isolation & Lifecycle Verification
* **The Rule:** End-to-End (E2E) test suites must NEVER run against your local development or production databases. Instead, the test suite setup (e.g., `conftest.py`) must dynamically hit the API to create a brand-new, isolated Test Tenant/Database specifically for that test run. All subsequent tests must inject this test tenant's ID into the `x-tenant-id` headers.
* **The Data Lifecycle Rule:** True E2E tests must verify the full CRUD lifecycle within that isolated database. Tests cannot rely on stub IDs. They must:
  1. **POST**: Create a uniquely identifiable record and extract its real ID from the `201` response.
  2. **GET by ID**: Fetch that exact ID and assert `200 OK`.
  3. **PATCH**: Update that exact ID and assert `200 OK`.
  4. **DELETE**: Delete that exact ID, and then make a follow-up `GET` request to mathematically verify a `404 Not Found` response is returned.
* **Why:** This architecture guarantees 100% test isolation, prevents test data pollution in your main database, and actively proves that your database provisioning systems are actually executing correctly under the hood.

---

## 44. Centralized API Rate Limit Tiers
* **The Rule:** Define distinct rate-limit tiers in a centralized `rate-limit.config.ts`. (e.g., Public Auth: 5 req/min, Authenticated Read: 100 req/min, Export: 2 req/min). Never hardcode rate limits inside controllers.

## 45. Webhook Signature Verification
* **The Rule:** All inbound webhooks (e.g., Payment gateways) MUST verify the cryptographic signature (HMAC-SHA256) before processing. Furthermore, check timestamps to prevent replay attacks.

## 46. Strict Input Sanitization Layer
* **The Rule:** Beyond validation, inputs must be sanitized. Strip HTML/script tags from free-text fields. Strip leading/trailing whitespaces. Normalize emails (lowercase) and phone numbers to canonical formats before saving.

## 47. Circuit Breaker Pattern for External Services
* **The Rule:** External adapters (WhatsApp, SMS, Payments) MUST be wrapped in a Circuit Breaker. If the external service fails repeatedly, the breaker opens, rejecting requests instantly with a `503` to prevent thread pool exhaustion, triggering a defined fallback queue.

## 48. CQRS Lite (Query vs Command Controllers)
* **The Rule:** Read operations (GET) and Write operations (POST/PATCH/DELETE) must be split into separate controllers (e.g., `[module]-query.controller.ts` and `[module]-command.controller.ts`). This guarantees AI never accidentally touches mutation logic when fixing a read query.

## 49. Explicit Module Dependency Graph
* **The Rule:** Every module must have a `[module]_dependencies.md` detailing which other modules it depends on, and which modules depend on it. This maps downstream impact instantly.

## 50. Standardized Event Naming Convention
* **The Rule:** Event names MUST follow `DOMAIN.ENTITY.ACTION` in SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (e.g., `BILLING.PAYMENT.FAILED`) and be registered in a centralized `event-registry.constants.ts`.

## 51. API Changelog & Deprecation Policy
* **The Rule:** When an endpoint changes destructively, do not delete it immediately. Return a `Deprecation` header with a sunset date, track it in `CHANGELOG.md`, and maintain it for the deprecation window.

## 52. JWT Refresh Token Rotation & Revocation
* **The Rule:** Access tokens must be short-lived. Refresh tokens must be stored in HttpOnly cookies. On every refresh, the old token must be rotated/invalidated. A Redis denylist must exist for immediate manual revocation.

## 53. Sensitive Field Encryption at Rest
* **The Rule:** Aadhaar numbers, bank accounts, and medical notes MUST be encrypted at the application layer (AES-256) before hitting the DB. Use an `@Encrypted` decorator or EncryptionService. Hash is not enough.

## 54. Brute Force & Account Lockout Policy
* **The Rule:** After 5 failed login attempts, the account is temporarily locked via Redis. Lockout state must be logged in the audit trail.

## 55. Deterministic Seed Data Strategy
* **The Rule:** Every module must have a co-located `[module].seeder.ts` that is deterministic and idempotent. A master seed script orchestrates them in dependency order for local testing.

## 56. Strict Null Safety in Repository Returns
* **The Rule:** Repositories must correctly type `findById()` as returning `Entity | null`. AI must use a dedicated `findByIdOrThrow()` method to ensure null exceptions are handled defensively.

## 57. Request Context Propagation (AsyncLocalStorage)
* **The Rule:** Use Node's `AsyncLocalStorage` to store context (tenant_id, user_id, trace_id) at the request boundary. Deep services/repositories must pull from this context rather than prop-drilling parameters through 5 layers of functions.

## 58. Standardized Database Entity Base Class
* **The Rule:** All database entities MUST extend a common `BaseEntity` class that explicitly defines `id` (UUID), `createdAt` (timestamp with timezone), `updatedAt` (timestamp with timezone), and `deletedAt` (nullable timestamp for soft deletes). AI must never manually define these fields per entity.
* **Base Repository Enforcement:** The global query filter for soft deletes (from Rule 29) MUST be implemented as a base repository method that ALL repositories extend from. Never duplicate the soft-delete query scope logic per-repository.

## 59. API Response Time SLA Categories
* **The Rule:** Every endpoint must declare its SLA category in a comment (`// SLA: FAST`). FAST (< 200ms), STANDARD (< 500ms), HEAVY (> 500ms). Heavy tasks must be moved to background jobs (Rule 23). Enforce via monitoring middleware.

## 60. Strict Foreign Key Naming Convention
* **The Rule:** Database columns must use `snake_case` (e.g., `member_id`). TypeScript entity properties must use `camelCase` (e.g., `memberId`). Explicitly map them using `@Column({ name: 'member_id' })`. Foreign key constraints must follow `FK_[table]_[referenced_table]`.

## 61. Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for Failed Background Jobs
* **The Rule:** Every background job queue (BullMQ/Celery) MUST have a configured Dead Letter Queue. If a job fails all retries, it must be moved to the DLQ (not discarded) so admins can manually inspect and retry it.

## 62. Explicit Return Types on ALL Service Methods
* **The Rule:** Relying on TypeScript implicit `any` or inferred returns is forbidden for async operations. Every service method and repository method MUST have an explicitly declared return type (e.g., `Promise<MemberEntity>`).

## 63. Database Connection Pool Configuration
* **The Rule:** Default ORM connection pools are forbidden. The `database.config.ts` must explicitly define `max` connections (e.g., 20), `acquireTimeout` (30000ms), and `idleTimeoutMillis` (10000ms). **CRITICAL for Multi-Tenancy (Rule 39):** This pool configuration applies to the GLOBAL connection manager, not per-tenant DataSource. With N tenants on the same DB server, the total active connections across all tenant DataSources must be budgeted carefully. Do NOT blindly apply `max: 20` per tenant DataSource or you will exhaust the database server's connection limit.

## 64. Structured Machine-Readable Error Codes
* **The Rule:** Error responses must include a machine-readable `errorCode` string following `DOMAIN.ENTITY.REASON` (e.g., `BILLING.SUBSCRIPTION.EXPIRED`). The frontend relies on this code to trigger specific UI logic (e.g., redirecting to a payment page).

## 65. File Upload Security & Validation
* **The Rule:** All file uploads must undergo MIME type validation (not just extension checking) and enforce strict size limits. Files must never be saved directly to the server disk; upload to cloud storage (e.g., S3). Original filenames must be discarded and replaced with a UUID.

## 66. Strict Database Table Naming Convention
* **The Rule:** All table names must be `plural_snake_case` (e.g., `payment_transactions`). Junction tables must combine the two table names alphabetically (e.g., `member_plans`). Never use legacy prefixes like `tbl_`. Enforce explicitly via `@Entity('table_name')`.

## 67. API Contract Freeze Before Frontend Development
* **The Rule:** The backend developer/AI must first write the DTOs and Swagger spec. This contract must be "frozen" and approved by the frontend layer before any backend implementation code is written. This prevents data shape mismatches.

## 68. Health Check Depth Levels
* **The Rule:** Implement 3 levels of health checks: `/health/live` (Process alive? 200 OK), `/health/ready` (DB/Redis reachable? Traffic ready), and `/health/deep` (Full dependency chain check, not exposed publicly).

## 69. Strict `tsconfig.json` Enforcement
* **The Rule:** The backend MUST run with `strict: true`. No `implicitAny`, no `implicitThis`. AI must never add `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck` to bypass type errors.

## 70. No Raw `any` from ORM
* **The Rule:** Never allow raw `any` types to escape the ORM layer. Query builder results or raw SQL executions must immediately be mapped to a strictly typed DTO or Entity class.

## 71. UTC Datetime Storage Format
* **The Rule:** ALL dates and times MUST be stored in the database as UTC. The backend must never store local timezones. Any datetime conversion for display purposes should happen purely on the frontend.

## 72. Per-Endpoint Payload Size Limits
* **The Rule:** The default global `1mb` limit (Rule 37) can be overridden per-endpoint for specific use cases. General endpoints must reject payloads >1MB. File-upload endpoints must explicitly declare their own larger limit (e.g., `10mb` for profile images, `50mb` for bulk import CSVs). These overrides must be declared in the endpoint's controller decorator, not scattered in middleware.

## 73. Currency and Number Formatting (Paise/Cents Integer Storage)
* **The Rule:** All monetary amounts MUST be stored and transmitted over the API as integers in the smallest currency unit (e.g., paise for INR, cents for USD). Never use floating-point types (`float`, `double`) or decimals for API transmission to avoid rounding errors. 
* **Frontend Responsibility:** The backend transmits `12345600` (paise). It is strictly the frontend's responsibility to divide by 100 and format it as `₹1,23,456.00` for display.

## 74. Mechanical Enforcement of Isolation (The "Tooling Gate")
* **The Rule:** The backend must explicitly enforce architectural boundaries mechanically. If using Node.js, mandate `eslint-plugin-boundaries` or `no-restricted-imports`. If using Python, mandate `import-linter`. This guarantees that an AI cannot accidentally import an `attendance` repository into a `billing` service. Trust is not enough; the pipeline must block cross-module violations.

## 75. Hard File-Size Ceilings (AI Context Limits)
* **The Rule:** To prevent token explosion and hallucination, backend files must strictly adhere to size limits. If a backend file exceeds its ceiling, the AI must explicitly pause and refactor it by splitting the logic into an Orchestrator/Facade and smaller micro-services.

| File Type | Maximum Lines |
|---|---|
| Controller (`*.controller.ts`) | **200 lines** |
| Service (`*.service.ts`) | **300 lines** |
| Repository (`*.repository.ts`) | **200 lines** |
| Entity/DTO (`*.entity.ts`, `*.dto.ts`) | **150 lines** |
| Module Config (`*.module.ts`) | **100 lines** |
| Utilities/Mappers | **120 lines** |

## 76. Strict File Responsibility Contract
* **The Rule:** Every backend controller, service, or repository MUST start with a single-line comment at the very top of the file explicitly defining its boundary. (e.g., `// RESPONSIBILITY: Processes incoming Stripe webhooks and emits EVENT_PAYMENT_SUCCESS. No direct DB writes.`). This instantly grounds the AI's context when reading the file.

## 77. Dependency-Addition Guardrail
* **The Rule:** An AI agent cannot blindly add new dependencies (`npm install` or `pip install`) without human approval. Before proposing a new library, the AI must check the `package.json` or `requirements.txt` to verify if an existing approved library (e.g., `date-fns` instead of adding `moment`, or a native ORM feature) can suffice for the task.

## 78. Forbidden Patterns File (`[moduleName]_forbidden.md`)
* **The Rule:** Every backend module must have a `[moduleName]_forbidden.md` file listing what is explicitly NOT allowed in that specific module.

### `_forbidden.md` Content Quality Standard

**Failure Conditions — A `_forbidden.md` FAILS quality review if it contains:**
- Fewer than 5 entries
- Generic entries not tied to a specific rule number (e.g., "Never bypass the Orchestrator" with no rule citation)
- Entries that apply to every module equally (e.g., "Do not use console.log") — those belong in the global instruction, not here
- Entries with no explanation of the consequence of violation

#### ❌ BAD — Generic, unactionable:
```markdown
# billing_forbidden.md
- Never bypass the Orchestrator for payments.
- Never mutate the DB without pessimistic locking.
- Do not use console.log.
- Do not bypass API interceptors.
```
*Why this fails: "Never bypass the Orchestrator" with no context tells an AI nothing about which specific call paths are forbidden or what breaks if violated.*

#### ✅ GOOD — Specific, rule-cited, consequence-explained:
```markdown
# billing_forbidden.md

## What is NEVER allowed in this module

1. **Never call BillingWalletRepository directly from outside BillingOrchestratorService.**
   Consequence: Wallet deductions outside the Orchestrator bypass the DB transaction
   boundary, causing partial charges where balance is deducted but plan is not activated.
   Rule: 8B (Orchestrator Pattern), Rule 41 (Pessimistic Locking).

2. **Never remove the SELECT FOR UPDATE lock from deductBalance().**
   Consequence: Concurrent top-up + deduction requests will race, producing negative
   wallet balances that cannot be recovered without manual DB correction.
   Rule: 41 (Transaction Locks & Race Condition Prevention).

3. **Never process a plan purchase and wallet deduction in separate transactions.**
   Consequence: A crash between the two operations leaves the member charged but
   without an active plan — a financial discrepancy requiring manual reconciliation.
   Rule: 8B (Orchestrator Pattern).

4. **Never omit the Idempotency-Key check on /billing/wallet/topup.**
   Consequence: Network retries from mobile clients will double-charge the member.
   Rule: 31 (Idempotency Keys for Critical Mutations).

5. **Never return raw MemberEntity or WalletEntity from billing service methods.**
   Consequence: ORM entity leakage means a DB column rename breaks service-layer
   callers that should be completely unaware of the schema.
   Rule: 89 (Domain Object vs ORM Entity Separation).
```

**Minimum requirement:** Every `_forbidden.md` must have at least **5 entries**, each with a specific consequence and a Rule citation.

## 79. Explicit Data Flow Direction Comment (AI Context Chain)
* **The Rule:** Just as the frontend mandates `// DATA FLOW: API → hook → Context → Component` on every hook file (Frontend Rule 39), every backend **service, controller, and repository** file MUST begin with an explicit data flow annotation comment below the responsibility comment.
* **Format:**
  ```
  // RESPONSIBILITY: Handles member suspension logic. No direct DB writes — emits events only.
  // FLOW: MemberCommandController → MemberSuspensionService → MemberRepository → EventBus.emit('MEMBER.SUSPENDED')
  ```
* **Why:** When an AI agent is given a single file to fix a bug, the `// FLOW:` comment instantly tells it the full chain of execution — what came before this file, and what happens after — without the AI needing to read any other file. This eliminates the single biggest cause of AI hallucination: not knowing what calls what.

---

## 80. Mandatory JSDoc on All Service Methods, Repositories & Utilities
* **The Rule:** Every service method, repository method, adapter method, and utility function MUST be prefixed with a JSDoc block. This mirrors Frontend Rule 37 which mandates JSDoc on all hooks and utilities.
* **What the JSDoc must include:**
  1. A one-line `@description` of what the method does.
  2. `@param` for every non-trivial argument.
  3. `@returns` with the exact type.
  4. `@throws` with the exact custom exception(s) it can throw (from Rule 6).
  5. For complex business logic: a `@remarks` note explaining the *why* behind a design decision (e.g., "Uses pessimistic lock because concurrent wallet deductions caused negative balances in load testing").
* **Example:**
  ```typescript
  /**
   * @description Suspends a member by setting their status to SUSPENDED and emitting the lifecycle event.
   * @param memberId - The UUID of the member to suspend.
   * @param actorId - The UUID of the staff member performing the action (for audit log).
   * @returns The updated MemberEntity with status SUSPENDED.
   * @throws MemberNotFoundException if the memberId does not exist.
   * @throws MemberAlreadySuspendedException if the member is already suspended.
   * @remarks Uses a database transaction to ensure the audit log write and status update are atomic.
   */
  async suspendMember(memberId: string, actorId: string): Promise<MemberEntity> { ... }
  ```
* **Why:** An AI fixing a bug in a billing service shouldn't need to read 300 lines to understand what `chargeWallet()` can throw. The JSDoc block is the file's self-contained API contract, drastically reducing token usage and hallucination risk.

---

## 81. Mock-First / Stub-First Development (Parallel Workflow Safety)
* **The Rule:** Just as the frontend is built with mock data before the backend exists, the backend MUST follow the reciprocal workflow: **every new endpoint must first be created as a fully-documented, working stub** before real business logic is written.
* **A "stub" means:**
  1. The controller and route exist and are registered.
  2. The Swagger/OpenAPI documentation for that endpoint is complete and accurate.
  3. The endpoint returns a hardcoded, realistic mock payload that exactly matches the final `ApiResponse<T>` envelope (Rule 28).
  4. The endpoint has `// TODO: Replace with real service call` comments.
* **Why this matters for parallel AI development:** If two AI agents are working simultaneously — one on the frontend UI, one on the backend logic — the frontend agent cannot make progress if the endpoint doesn't exist at all. A working stub with realistic mock data allows the frontend to be fully built and tested against the API contract before the backend implementation is written. This prevents entire feature branches from being blocked.
* **Enforcement:** A stub endpoint MUST never be merged to `main` without either: (a) having its real implementation, OR (b) having a GitHub issue linked in a `// STUB: [link]` comment.

---

## 82. Strict Discriminated Union Response Rule (No Ambiguous `data` Shapes)
* **The Rule:** The `data` field in the standardized API envelope (Rule 28) MUST always be a **single, explicitly typed value** — never a polymorphic bag of mixed objects. The shape of `data` on success MUST be identical in structure regardless of the execution path.
  - ❌ **BAD (Ambiguous):** `data: { member: MemberEntity, invoice: InvoiceEntity }` — the frontend `ApiResponse<T>` generic breaks because `T` is not a single entity.
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `data: MemberWithInvoiceDTO` — a single, explicitly defined DTO that contains both.
  - ❌ **BAD (Inconsistent):** One code path returns `data: MemberEntity`, another returns `data: { member: MemberEntity }`.
  - ✅ **GOOD:** Always `data: MemberEntity` — one shape, all paths.
* **The Discriminated Union Rule for Errors:** Never put different error shapes inside `data`. All error information belongs strictly in the `error` and `errorCode` fields of the envelope (Rule 64). The `data` field must always be `null` on error responses. No exceptions.
* **Why:** The frontend AI agent generating the type-safe API call relies on `ApiResponse<MemberEntity>` mapping exactly. If the backend AI returns `data: { member: MemberEntity }` instead of `data: MemberEntity`, the TypeScript type system on the frontend will silently pass (because of structural typing) but every `res.data.name` call will return `undefined`, creating bugs that are extremely hard to trace.

---

## 83. Centralized RBAC / Permission Guards (Role-Based Access Control)
* **The Rule:** Role and permission checks must NEVER be done inline inside service methods or repository layers (e.g., `if (user.role === 'admin')`). Permission enforcement is strictly a **controller-layer concern** and must be implemented using centralized, declarative guards or decorators.
* **How to implement per framework:**
  - **NestJS:** Use a `@Roles(...)` custom decorator paired with a global `RolesGuard` that reads the JWT payload. Never check `req.user.role` inside a service.
  - **Django:** Use Django REST Framework's `IsAuthenticated` + custom `Permission` classes (e.g., `IsAdminOrManager`). Never check `request.user.is_staff` inside a view's business logic.
  - **Express:** Implement a `requireRoles(...roles)` middleware factory that is mounted per-route. Never check roles inside a controller handler.
* **Fine-Grained Resource Permissions:** For resource-level checks (e.g., "Can this manager see only their branch's members?"), create a dedicated `[module]-authorization.service.ts`. This service receives the actor and the resource and returns a boolean. The controller calls this service before delegating to the business service.
* **Centralized Role Registry:** All role names and permission strings MUST be defined as enums in a central `auth.roles.constants.ts` file. Never use raw strings like `'admin'` or `'manager'` directly in guards or decorators.
  - ❌ **BAD:** `@Roles('admin', 'superadmin')`
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `@Roles(UserRole.ADMIN, UserRole.SUPERADMIN)`
* **Why:** Just as the frontend mandates `usePermissions()` for hiding restricted UI elements (Frontend Rule 25), the backend must enforce the same contract at the API layer. An AI writing a new endpoint will forget to add auth checks if there is no standard, centralized pattern to follow. A declarative decorator is impossible to forget because it's visible at the route definition.

---

## 84. No Barrel File / Re-Export Index Rule
* **The Rule:** Strictly avoid using `index.ts` or `index.js` files to re-export modules (barrel files). This mirrors Frontend Rule 32. Always import directly from the explicitly named source file.
  - ❌ **BAD:** `import { MemberService } from '@/modules/members'` (where `members/index.ts` re-exports everything)
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `import { MemberRegistrationService } from '@/modules/members/services/member-registration.service'`
* **Why barrel files are dangerous in AI-driven codebases:**
  1. **Circular Dependencies:** Barrel files are the #1 cause of circular dependency errors in NestJS and Express projects. An AI adding a new export to a barrel file can silently create a circular import cycle that causes runtime crashes.
  2. **AI Context Pollution:** When an AI imports `from '@/modules/members'`, it loads the entire barrel into context — all services, all DTOs, all repositories. With direct imports, the AI only loads exactly what it needs, drastically reducing hallucination risk.
  3. **Dead Code Masking:** Barrel files make tree-shaking and unused-code detection nearly impossible, hiding dead code from AI and human reviewers alike.
* **Enforcement:** Mechanically enforce via ESLint `no-restricted-imports` or a custom rule that flags imports from `index.ts` paths.

---

## 85. Guard Clause / Early Return Pattern (No Nested Conditional Hell)
* **The Rule:** Deeply nested `if/else` blocks inside service methods are strictly forbidden. This mirrors Frontend Rule 51 which bans ternary hell. All service methods MUST use the **Guard Clause** (Early Return) pattern: validate inputs and exit early at the top of the function, keeping the happy path flat and readable.
  - ❌ **BAD (Nested):**
    ```typescript
    async suspendMember(id: string) {
      const member = await this.repo.findById(id);
      if (member) {
        if (member.status !== 'SUSPENDED') {
          if (member.hasActiveSubscription) {
            // ... actual logic buried 3 levels deep
          } else { throw new Error('No subscription'); }
        } else { throw new Error('Already suspended'); }
      } else { throw new Error('Not found'); }
    }
    ```
  - ✅ **GOOD (Guard Clauses):**
    ```typescript
    async suspendMember(id: string) {
      const member = await this.repo.findByIdOrThrow(id); // throws MemberNotFoundException
      if (member.status === 'SUSPENDED') throw new MemberAlreadySuspendedException(id);
      if (!member.hasActiveSubscription) throw new NoActiveSubscriptionException(id);
      // happy path — completely flat, no nesting
      member.status = 'SUSPENDED';
      return this.repo.save(member);
    }
    ```
* **Maximum Nesting Depth:** No function body may have more than **2 levels of indentation** for conditional logic. If a third level is needed, extract it into a private helper method.
* **Why:** An AI given a deeply nested 80-line service method will frequently misread the logic branches and introduce bugs at the wrong `else` block. A flat, guard-clause-driven function is scannable in 5 seconds, making AI edits surgical and safe.

---

## 86. Strict Method Naming Convention (The Verb Contract)
* **The Rule:** All service and repository method names MUST follow a strict, predictable verb-based naming convention. AI agents must never invent arbitrary method names. The convention is:

  | Operation | Service Layer Verb | Repository Layer Verb |
  |---|---|---|
  | Create | `create[Entity](dto)` | `save(entity)` |
  | Read single | `find[Entity]ById(id)` | `findById(id)` |
  | Read single (throws) | `find[Entity]ByIdOrThrow(id)` | `findByIdOrThrow(id)` |
  | Read list | `findAll[Entities](filters)` | `findAll(filters)` |
  | Update | `update[Entity](id, dto)` | `save(entity)` |
  | Soft Delete | `delete[Entity](id)` | `softDelete(id)` |
  | Check existence | `does[Entity]Exist(id)` | `existsById(id)` |
  | Count | `count[Entities](filters)` | `count(filters)` |

* **The `OrThrow` Pattern:** Repository methods that return a single entity MUST have two variants: `findById(id): Entity | null` (returns null if not found) and `findByIdOrThrow(id): Entity` (throws `EntityNotFoundException` if not found). Services must choose explicitly — never let a `null` propagate silently.
* **Why:** When two different AI agents work on two different modules, they will produce consistent, predictable method signatures. Any AI reading a repository interface instantly knows what methods are available without having to read the implementation. This eliminates the most common AI mistake: calling a method that doesn't exist (hallucinated method names).

---

## 87. Single Responsibility at Method Level (The 20-Line Rule)
* **The Rule:** Just as the frontend mandates hook separation to split logic from UI (Frontend Rule 6), the backend mandates that **every service method must do exactly ONE thing**. If a method is doing more than one distinct business operation, it must be split into private helper methods or separate micro-services.
* **The 20-Line Soft Ceiling:** A service method body (excluding JSDoc) should rarely exceed ~20 lines. If a method grows beyond this, it is a signal that it is doing too much and must be decomposed.
* **Decomposition Pattern:**
  - ❌ **BAD:** A single `registerMember()` method that validates, saves the member, creates a subscription, charges the card, sends a welcome email, and writes an audit log — all in one 80-line function.
  - ✅ **GOOD:** `registerMember()` is an Orchestrator (Rule 8B) that calls: `this.memberRepo.save(member)`, then emits `EventBus.emit('MEMBER.REGISTERED', ...)`. The subscription creation, payment charging, and email are handled by separate listeners.
* **Private Helper Rule:** If a method needs a private helper for a sub-calculation (e.g., calculating a pro-rated amount), the helper must be a `private` method with its own JSDoc (Rule 80) clearly named for its specific task (e.g., `private calculateProRatedAmount()`).
* **Why:** An AI asked to "add audit logging to member registration" should be able to do so by touching exactly ONE file and ONE method — the event listener for `MEMBER.REGISTERED`. If the entire registration flow is monolithic, the AI must read and modify a 200-line method, risking collateral damage.

---

## 88. Strict Import Order Convention (Mechanical ESLint Enforcement)
* **The Rule:** All backend TypeScript/JavaScript files MUST enforce a strict, consistent import order. This mirrors Frontend Rule 49. Configure ESLint's `import/order` rule to enforce the following groups in this exact sequence:
  1. **Node.js built-ins** (e.g., `node:fs`, `node:path`)
  2. **Framework core** (e.g., `@nestjs/common`, `express`, `django`)
  3. **Third-party packages** (e.g., `typeorm`, `class-validator`, `bcrypt`)
  4. **Internal absolute imports — Infrastructure** (e.g., `@/config/`, `@/database/`)
  5. **Internal absolute imports — Module-specific** (e.g., `@/modules/billing/...`)
  6. **Relative imports** (strictly forbidden per Rule 10 — this group must always be empty)
  7. **Type-only imports** (`import type { ... }`) must always be last
* **Blank line separation:** Each group must be separated by a blank line. No mixing of groups.
* **Example:**
  ```typescript
  import * as crypto from 'node:crypto';

  import { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';

  import { Repository } from 'typeorm';
  import * as bcrypt from 'bcrypt';

  import { DatabaseConfig } from '@/config/database.config';

  import { MemberEntity } from '@/modules/members/entities/member.entity';
  import { MemberNotFoundException } from '@/modules/members/exceptions/member.exceptions';

  import type { CreateMemberDto } from '@/modules/members/dtos/member-create.dto';
  ```
* **Why:** Chaotic import ordering in AI-generated code causes two specific problems: (1) Merge conflicts explode because every AI agent adds imports in a different location, (2) Circular dependency detection becomes nearly impossible because the import graph is visually unreadable. A strict, mechanical ESLint rule makes import diffs surgical and circular deps immediately obvious.

---

## 89. Domain Object vs. ORM Entity Separation (Anti-Persistence-Leakage Rule)
* **The Rule:** Never use ORM Entity classes (e.g., TypeORM `@Entity()` classes, Django ORM models) directly inside business logic services. ORM entities are a **persistence infrastructure concern** — they contain database annotations, lazy-loading relations, and schema metadata that have no place in pure business logic.
* **The Pattern — Two Distinct Objects + Mapper:**
  1. **ORM Entity** (`member.entity.ts`): Contains only database schema definition — `@Column`, `@ManyToOne`, `@Index` decorators. Lives in the repository layer only.
  2. **Domain Object / DTO** (`member.domain.ts` or `member.dto.ts`): A plain TypeScript class/interface with pure business properties and zero ORM imports. This is what services, controllers, and event handlers receive and return.
  3. **Mapper** (`member.mapper.ts`): A dedicated class with `toDomain(entity)` and `toEntity(domain)` static methods that translate between the two. Only the repository layer calls the mapper.
* **When it's acceptable to use a unified model:** For simple CRUD-only modules with no complex business rules, a unified ORM entity may be used provided: (a) it has no business logic methods on the class itself, and (b) you acknowledge the tradeoff in the module's `_backend_feature.md`.
* **Why:** AI agents default to using ORM entities everywhere — passing `MemberEntity` into services, emitting it over the EventBus, returning it from controllers. This "persistence leakage" means a database schema change (e.g., renaming a column) breaks business logic files that should be completely unaware of the database. A Mapper is the single controlled translation point, and it is the only file the AI needs to touch when the schema changes.

---

## 90. Automated Security Gates in CI/CD Pipeline (Shift-Left Security)
* **The Rule:** All backend AI-generated code is **untrusted input** until proven otherwise. Research shows ~45% of AI code suggestions can introduce security vulnerabilities. The CI/CD pipeline MUST implement non-bypassable automated security gates on every Pull Request before any merge is allowed.
* **Mandatory Gate 1 — SAST (Static Application Security Testing):** Run a SAST scanner (e.g., `Semgrep`, `SonarQube`, `CodeQL`) on every PR. Any `Critical` or `High` severity finding MUST block the merge. AI agents cannot self-certify their own code as secure.
* **Mandatory Gate 2 — SCA (Software Composition Analysis):** Run a dependency vulnerability scanner (e.g., `npm audit`, `safety` for Python, `Snyk`) on every PR. Any new dependency with a known `Critical` CVE must block the merge.
* **Mandatory Gate 3 — Secrets Detection:** Run a secrets scanner (e.g., `GitLeaks`, `Trufflehog`) on every PR diff. A single hardcoded API key or database password in a commit is a catastrophic security breach. This gate must never be skipped.
* **Mandatory Gate 4 — TypeScript Strict Compile Check:** Run `tsc --noEmit` on every PR. The build must pass with zero type errors — no `@ts-ignore` bypasses allowed (Rule 69).
* **Why:** Frontend Rule 61 mandates mechanical tooling gates for the frontend. The backend requires the exact same discipline but with an added focus on security. An AI writing authentication or payment code must have its output automatically vetted before it reaches production.

---

## 91. Mandatory Backend Pre-Commit Hooks (Blocking Gates Before Push)
* **The Rule:** This mirrors Frontend Rule 61's `husky + lint-staged` mandate. The backend repository MUST configure pre-commit hooks using `husky` (Node.js) or `pre-commit` framework (Python) to run fast, blocking checks before every `git push`. These hooks run locally on the developer/AI agent's machine — they are the first line of defense before code reaches CI.
* **Required Pre-Commit Checks (must all pass):**
  1. `tsc --noEmit` — TypeScript type check. Zero errors required.
  2. `eslint --fix` — Auto-fix lint violations; fail if unfixable violations remain.
  3. `prettier --check` — Code format verification.
  4. `gitleaks detect --no-git` — Secret scanning on staged files only (fast).
* **Staged Files Only:** Use `lint-staged` to run checks only on the files in the current commit. Running checks on the entire codebase on every commit is too slow and will cause developers/AI agents to bypass the hooks.
* **Why:** CI/CD gates (Rule 90) catch issues at the PR stage, which means an AI agent can push broken/insecure code to the remote branch. Pre-commit hooks catch the same issues before the push ever happens, providing instant feedback and preventing noise in the PR history.

---

## 92. ORM Raw Input Injection Prevention (The TypeORM Safety Rule)
* **The Rule:** Never interpolate user-controlled input directly into ORM query methods. This is a critical AI-specific risk because AI agents frequently generate "convenient" but insecure query patterns, especially in TypeORM's QueryBuilder.
* **The Specific Patterns to BAN:**
  - ❌ **BAD (SQL Injection via `orderBy`):**
    ```typescript
    // NEVER do this — sortField comes from req.query and is unvalidated
    queryBuilder.orderBy(`member.${req.query.sortField}`, 'ASC');
    ```
  - ✅ **GOOD (Allowlist Pattern):**
    ```typescript
    const ALLOWED_SORT_FIELDS = ['name', 'createdAt', 'status'] as const;
    type SortField = typeof ALLOWED_SORT_FIELDS[number];
    const sortField = ALLOWED_SORT_FIELDS.includes(req.query.sortField as SortField)
      ? req.query.sortField as SortField
      : 'createdAt'; // safe default
    queryBuilder.orderBy(`member.${sortField}`, 'ASC');
    ```
  - ❌ **BAD (Raw SQL with template literals):**
    ```typescript
    // NEVER — classic SQL injection
    queryBuilder.where(`member.name = '${req.query.name}'`);
    ```
  - ✅ **GOOD (Parameterized query):**
    ```typescript
    queryBuilder.where('member.name = :name', { name: req.query.name });
    ```
* **Allowlist-First Mandate:** Any query that uses a user-supplied column name, sort field, or filter key MUST validate it against a strict allowlist defined in the module's constants file before passing it to the ORM.
* **Why:** TypeORM's query builder accepts raw column name strings in `orderBy`, `select`, and `where` which are NOT automatically parameterized. An AI will generate `orderBy(`member.${sortColumn}`)` as a clean, "logical" pattern without realizing it's an injection vulnerability. This rule makes the safe pattern the only acceptable pattern.

---

## 93. Human-in-the-Loop Gate for Security-Critical AI Code
* **The Rule:** Certain backend modules and functions are so security-critical that AI-generated code for them requires mandatory human review before merging — no exceptions, even if all automated gates pass. These are modules where a single bug can cause financial loss, data breach, or unauthorized access.
* **Mandatory Human Review Required For:**
  1. **Authentication & Token Logic** — Any code in `auth/` modules, JWT generation/validation, refresh token rotation (Rule 52), session management.
  2. **Authorization & Permission Guards** — Any new `@Roles()` decorator usage, `RolesGuard` modifications, resource-level authorization services (Rule 83).
  3. **Payment & Financial Mutations** — Any code that triggers charges, refunds, wallet deductions, or invoice generation.
  4. **Database Migration Files** — Any migration that adds `NOT NULL`, drops a column, or modifies a primary key. (Rule 24).
  5. **Webhook Signature Verification** — Any code in webhook handlers that verifies HMAC/cryptographic signatures (Rule 45). A bypass here allows forged payment/delivery events to trigger real financial or state-changing actions — the risk is equivalent to a direct payment mutation.
  6. **Tenant Provisioning & Connection Routing** — Any code that creates a new tenant database, runs migrations programmatically, or resolves the `x-tenant-id` to a DataSource (Rule 39). A bug here risks cross-tenant data leakage — the single most severe failure mode in this architecture. This includes both the provisioning flow AND any modification to the request-scoped connection resolver.
* **Implementation:** In GitHub/GitLab, create a `CODEOWNERS` file mapping these folders to specific human reviewers. PRs touching these paths cannot be merged without a human approval even if all CI gates pass.
* **PR Description Mandate:** Any PR touching these modules MUST include a section titled `## Security Impact Analysis` explaining what changed, what the risk surface is, and why the change is safe.
* **Why:** Industry research confirms that ~45% of AI-generated code can introduce vulnerabilities, and the risk is highest in security-critical paths. An AI agent might generate a logically correct but cryptographically weak JWT validation, or a permission guard with a subtle bypass. Automated tools cannot catch all semantic security flaws — a human security review is the final, non-negotiable gate.

## Updated Summary Checklist (v5 — Final):
1. Identify the exact layer (Validation? Query? Business Logic? External Adapter? Permission Guard? Mapper?).
2. Select the **one or two** micro-files associated with that layer.
3. Check the module's `_backend_feature.md` for context before giving the AI any files.
4. Pass ONLY those files to the AI along with the feature doc.
5. After the AI writes code, verify:
   - Is there an N+1 query?
   - Is there a missing null check (use `findByIdOrThrow` where needed)?
   - Is a secret hardcoded? (Auto-blocked by pre-commit hook — Rule 91)
   - Is the response wrapped in the standard envelope with a single consistent `data` shape — is `data` a single explicitly typed value, never a polymorphic bag? (Rule 82)
   - Is the permission guard at the controller layer using typed enums? (Rule 83)
   - Is any ORM `orderBy` or `where` using user input without an allowlist? (Rule 92)
   - Are there any barrel file imports or relative path imports?
   - Does every new method follow the verb naming convention with `OrThrow` where needed? (Rule 86)
   - Is every new method ≤ 20 lines using Guard Clauses? (Rule 85/87)
   - Does every new file have `// RESPONSIBILITY:` + `// FLOW:` + JSDoc on every method? (Rules 76/79/80)
   - Is a Mapper used to translate between ORM entities and domain objects? (Rule 89)
   - For mutation endpoints: is an `Idempotency-Key` header supported to prevent double-execution? (Rule 31)
   - For background job queues: is a Dead Letter Queue configured for all retry-exhausted jobs? (Rule 61)
   - If the change touches `auth/`, `billing/`, `webhooks/`, or `tenant-provisioning/`, has a human reviewed it? (Rule 93)
6. Run automated CI gates: SAST, SCA, secrets scan, `tsc --noEmit`. (Rule 90)
7. Run `pytest` against the live API to confirm contract compliance.
8. For security-critical modules, ensure `CODEOWNERS` human approval is obtained. (Rule 93)
9. Review the AI's isolated changes one final time.
