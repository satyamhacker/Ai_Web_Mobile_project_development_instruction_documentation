Currently, no one writes code manually; AI writes it. Because of this, my primary goal is extreme isolation. **Primary isolation goal:** Prefer single-file repair when the dependency graph allows it. The guaranteed isolation boundary is the owning module. An AI MUST NOT require unrelated business modules for a module-local repair. However, the folder architecture must remain highly organized and visually logical so that human developers can easily navigate it without getting lost in a flat directory of 50+ files.

Please follow these strict architectural rules:

1. **Micro-Modularization, Feature-Based Sub-folders & File Size Ceilings (Crucial)**: 
Break down all large or mixed files. Every **React component file** MUST contain one primary React component. Non-component files MAY contain multiple closely related declarations when they represent one cohesive responsibility, such as an API service for one entity family, a schema family, or a constants set. **CRITICAL:** Do not dump all these micro-files into a single flat directory. Group them logically into cohesive sub-folders within the module. 
**IMPORTANT FOLDER NAMING:** Always prefix the main internal folders with the module name (e.g., use `[moduleName]_components/`, `[moduleName]_context/`, `[moduleName]_utils/` instead of generic names like `components/`). This ensures that when providing context to an AI (using `@`), the AI only loads the exact folder for this module, avoiding cross-module hallucinations. Inside these prefixed folders, group files logically (e.g., `[moduleName]_components/Header/`).
**File Size Ceiling:** React Component: hard maximum 300 lines. If a component's JSX grows beyond that, extract sub-sections into their own child component files inside the same feature folder to force real component-level granularity.

### Extended File Size Ceilings

The component size limit alone is insufficient. AI agents also lose context in large hooks, stores, schemas, and utility files.

- React Component (`.tsx`): maximum 300 lines
- Custom Hook (`use*.ts`): maximum 150 lines
- Utility / formatter file: maximum 120 lines
- Zustand Store (`*.store.ts`): maximum 180 lines
- Zod Schema / type file (`*.types.ts`, `*.schema.ts`): maximum 200 lines
- API service file (`*.api.ts`): maximum 200 lines

If a file exceeds its limit:
- Split by feature responsibility, not randomly by line count.
- Do not create generic dumping folders such as `helpers/`, `common/`, or `misc/`.
- Keep extracted files inside the same feature folder wherever possible.
Next.js App Router uses Server Components by default, so you MUST explicitly include `"use client";` at the top of any file that uses hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`) or event listeners.

## 1A. Complete Module Self-Containment Contract

Every feature/module must be self-contained to the maximum practical extent.

Everything that is specific to a feature/module MUST live inside that module's root folder.

This includes:

- Components
- Hooks
- Contexts
- Module-scoped state
- API clients
- Types
- Schemas
- Constants
- Feature-specific utilities
- Tests
- Mock fixtures
- MSW handlers
- Feature documentation
- Forbidden-pattern documentation
- Theme contract documentation
- Other feature-specific configuration or test-support files

Nothing that is specific to a module's business behavior may be moved into a generic global folder merely for convenience.

The purpose of this rule is AI context isolation:

If an AI agent is asked to fix a bug inside one module, the preferred context should be the module folder itself. The module should contain the code, tests, mock behavior, and documentation required to understand and safely modify that module.

### Application Infrastructure Boundary

Some framework/application infrastructure MUST remain outside feature modules because it represents application-wide plumbing that cannot safely or meaningfully be duplicated per feature.

Allowed application-level infrastructure includes only genuinely global infrastructure such as:

* Framework-required application routing/layout infrastructure
* Global API transport/base HTTP client
* Global authentication/session/token infrastructure
* Global error-monitoring adapter
* Global application configuration
* Global logging infrastructure
* Global design-system primitives that contain zero business logic
* Global MSW bootstrap/registration infrastructure
* Other framework/application plumbing that is explicitly documented as global

IMPORTANT:

The existence of multiple consumers does NOT automatically make a file global infrastructure.

A file qualifies as application infrastructure only when ALL of the following are true:

1. It provides framework/application plumbing.
2. It contains zero feature-specific business behavior.
3. It is intentionally application-wide.
4. Duplicating it per feature would create conflicting, invalid, or unnecessary framework behavior.
5. Its responsibility is stable and explicitly documented.

The following are NOT global infrastructure:

* feature-specific business components
* feature-specific hooks
* feature-specific stores
* feature-specific API services
* feature-specific types
* feature-specific schemas
* feature-specific constants
* feature-specific utilities
* feature-specific validators
* feature-specific formatters
* feature-specific mock fixtures
* feature-specific MSW handlers
* feature-specific tests
* feature-specific business workflows
* feature-specific permissions
* feature-specific business configuration

Do NOT create a global business layer merely to avoid duplication.

If two features contain similar business behavior, duplication is allowed and is preferred when duplication improves AI isolation and feature portability.

> **CRITICAL WARNING TO AI AGENTS:** 
> Do NOT attempt to "DRY up" business components by moving them to global folders like `src/components/ui/`. 
> Components like "Date Filters", "Business Dropdowns", or "Status Badges" that contain domain-specific data/constants (e.g. "Last 3 Months", "Active") MUST be duplicated per feature, NEVER globalized. 
> `src/components/ui/` is strictly for dumb, zero-business primitives (like raw Buttons, Inputs, Dialogs).

---

### 1B. HIERARCHICAL MODULE BOUNDARY — FEATURE MODULE IS THE AI REPAIR UNIT

The project MUST use the following architectural hierarchy:

```text
APPLICATION
  └── ROLE CONTAINER
        └── FEATURE MODULE
              └── FEATURE SUB-FEATURES / CHILD COMPONENTS
```

This hierarchy applies to EVERY frontend project regardless of business domain.

Examples:

```text
src/app/admin/
src/app/manager/
src/app/superadmin/
src/app/trainer/
```

are ROLE CONTAINERS.

Examples of FEATURE MODULES may include:

```text
src/app/admin/members/
src/app/admin/billing/
src/app/manager/attendance/
src/app/superadmin/plans/
src/app/superadmin/reports/
src/app/superadmin/gyms/
src/app/settings/profile/
src/app/analytics/
```

The exact names will differ by project.

IMPORTANT:

A ROLE CONTAINER is NOT itself the default AI repair boundary.

A FEATURE MODULE is the default AI repair boundary.

For example:

```text
ROLE CONTAINER:
`/superadmin/`

FEATURE MODULE:
`/superadmin/plans/`
```

Therefore:

```text
/superadmin/
```

is not the normal context that should be provided to an AI for a Plans bug.

The normal repair context is:

```text
/superadmin/plans/
```

---

### Feature Module Self-Containment Requirement

Every feature module MUST own all business-specific artifacts required to understand, test, mock, document, and modify that feature.

Where applicable, the feature module MUST contain:

```text
[feature]/
├── [feature]_components/
├── [feature]_hooks/
├── [feature]_store/
├── [feature]_context/
├── [feature]_api/
├── [feature]_types/
├── [feature]_schemas/
├── [feature]_constants/
├── [feature]_utils/
├── [feature]_mocks/
├── [feature]_tests/
├── [feature]_features.md
├── [feature]_forbidden.md
├── [feature]_theme_contract.md
└── [feature]_url_config.ts
```

Only folders that are actually required by the feature need to exist.

The important requirement is ownership, not the creation of empty folders.

Anything containing business behavior specific to the feature MUST live inside that feature module.

---

### NO ROLE-WIDE BUSINESS BUCKETS

The project MUST NOT create role-wide business folders such as:

```text
superadmin_components/
superadmin_hooks/
superadmin_store/
superadmin_api/
superadmin_types/
superadmin_schemas/
superadmin_constants/
superadmin_utils/
superadmin_mocks/
superadmin_tests/
```

when those files contain business behavior belonging to individual features.

Instead, feature-specific responsibilities MUST remain inside the owning feature:

```text
superadmin/
├── plans/
│   ├── plans_components/
│   ├── plans_hooks/
│   ├── plans_api/
│   ├── plans_types/
│   ├── plans_schemas/
│   ├── plans_constants/
│   ├── plans_utils/
│   ├── plans_mocks/
│   └── plans_tests/
│
├── invoices/
│   ├── invoices_components/
│   ├── invoices_hooks/
│   ├── invoices_api/
│   ├── invoices_types/
│   ├── invoices_schemas/
│   ├── invoices_utils/
│   ├── invoices_mocks/
│   └── invoices_tests/
│
└── reports/
    └── ...
```

The same principle applies to every role and every domain.

---

### AI PORTABILITY CONTRACT

A feature module is considered AI-portable only when an AI can receive the feature directory as its primary context and understand the feature's:

* purpose
* user flows
* UI
* state ownership
* API contract
* schemas
* business constants
* business utilities
* mock behavior
* tests
* error handling
* loading/empty behavior
* permissions
* documented external application dependencies

without receiving unrelated sibling business modules.

The canonical workflow is:

```text
FEATURE BUG
   ↓
PROVIDE ONLY THE FEATURE MODULE
   ↓
AI READS THE FEATURE'S FEATURE MAP
   ↓
AI UNDERSTANDS THE FEATURE
   ↓
AI REPAIRS THE FEATURE
   ↓
AI RUNS FEATURE TESTS
   ↓
ONLY FEATURE FILES ARE CHANGED
```

For example, if a bug exists in:

```text
/admin/billing/
```

the preferred AI context is:

```text
/admin/billing/
```

NOT:

```text
/admin/
```

and NOT:

```text
the entire application
```

unless the feature documentation explicitly identifies an unavoidable application-infrastructure dependency that is genuinely required for the repair.

---

### PORTABILITY TO OTHER PROJECTS

Feature modules SHOULD be designed so that they can be copied into another compatible frontend application with minimal integration work.

A copied feature MUST NOT depend on hidden business files from its previous application.

After copying, only application-specific integration work should normally be necessary, such as:

* route registration
* application configuration
* authentication wiring
* approved global UI/infrastructure integration
* backend endpoint/environment configuration
* project-specific styling or branding adjustments

Hidden business dependencies from the source application's other modules are forbidden.

---

### DUPLICATION IS ALLOWED AND PREFERRED WHEN IT IMPROVES ISOLATION

Traditional DRY principles MUST NOT override the project's AI isolation requirement.

If two independent features need similar business behavior, they MAY contain duplicated implementations.

Example:

```text
/admin/billing/billing_utils/
```

and

```text
/manager/billing/billing_utils/
```

may contain similar code.

This is intentional when duplication prevents cross-feature business coupling.

The primary optimization target is:

```text
AI CONTEXT ISOLATION
+
BOUNDED CHANGE BLAST RADIUS
+
FEATURE PORTABILITY
```

not minimum source-code duplication.

---

### Canonical Definition

For this document:

```text
Application
= entire frontend application

Role Container
= route/organizational boundary for a role or application area

Feature Module
= smallest independently understandable business unit

AI Repair Boundary
= Feature Module
```

The term "module" in all isolation, portability, dependency, and AI repair rules MUST refer to the FEATURE MODULE unless a rule explicitly states otherwise.

2. **Total Role Isolation (No Shared Business Components)**:
To completely eliminate the risk of cross-role AI hallucinations, there is no unified global business folder across roles or application areas. Each role gets a completely isolated root folder (e.g., `/admin`, `/manager`, `/trainer`). Business components (like `MembersTable`) must be duplicated into the owning feature module of each role (`AdminMembersTable.tsx` inside `/admin/members/`, `ManagerMembersTable.tsx` inside `/manager/members/`). Business components MUST NOT be placed directly in the role container merely because they belong to that role. Only dumb UI components (like `Button`) are shared in `src/components/ui`.

3. **Hyper-Descriptive Naming & Mandatory Module Prefix**: 
Rename all components, files, and folders to be extremely descriptive based on exactly what they do. **It does not matter if a filename becomes exceptionally long** (e.g., `AdminMembersSubscriptionRenewalForm.tsx`). Meaningfulness and convenience are the only priorities. 
- **Module Name Prefixing (CRITICAL):** Every file name (not just the containing folder) MUST begin with the module name as a prefix. Example: `AdminBillingInvoiceSearchBox.tsx`.
- **Framework-reserved filenames are exempt from the module-prefix naming rule.** This includes `page.tsx`, `layout.tsx`, `loading.tsx`, `error.tsx`, `not-found.tsx`, `route.ts`, and other filenames mandated by Next.js/framework conventions. All non-reserved module-owned files MUST use the module prefix.
- Test files are also module-owned files and MUST follow module prefixing, while retaining the source artifact's semantic basename. Example: `ManagerMembersTable.test.tsx`, `useManagerMembersTable.test.ts`, `ManagerMembersFormatting.test.ts`.
- **Export Name Matching:** The primary React component, class, or primary exported callable inside the file MUST exactly match the filename (minus extension). Utility/schema/constants files are exempt from this exact-name matching rule unless a single primary export is intentionally defined.
- **No Abbreviations**: Never use `Btn`, `Nav`, `Utils`. Use `Button`, `Navigation`, `Utilities`.
- **Strict Suffixing**: Component names must end with their exact UI structural type (e.g., `...Modal.tsx`, `...Table.tsx`, `...Form.tsx`, `...Card.tsx`, `...Dropdown.tsx`).
- **Prop Naming**: Do not export generic `Props` or `Data` interfaces. Always prefix them (e.g., `export interface InquiriesTableProps`).

3B. **Backend-Ready Centralized Data (Single Source of Truth)**: 
Find all hardcoded UI data (dropdown options, filter lists, default preset arrays, payment modes, etc.) scattered across the UI components. Extract them into feature-specific constant files alongside their components (e.g., `HeaderConstants.ts` inside the `/Header` folder) or a module-level `[ModuleName]SharedConstants.ts` for data used across multiple sub-folders.
*Why?* Centralizing static UI configuration minimizes UI changes when a backend source is introduced; the backend transition must still update the API contract, types, schema, mock layer, and API client as required. Derive your TypeScript types directly from these central arrays where applicable.

### 3B.1 Static UI Configuration vs Server/API Data

The following separation is mandatory:

Static UI Configuration
→ Feature-specific constants

Server/API Data
→ API contract
→ TypeScript types
→ Zod schema
→ Module-owned MSW fixtures (frontend-first development)
→ Module API client
→ Real backend in production

UI State
→ Local state / module-scoped Zustand

Server State
→ TanStack Query

Never store backend-driven data as ordinary UI constants merely because the backend is not available yet.

For example:

- Status definitions may be feature constants when they are truly static UI configuration.
- Gym records, member records, invoice records, analytics results, etc. are server/API data even when mocked.
- Mocked server data MUST therefore live in the module's mock/fixture layer, not in component constants.

4. **Theme Independence & Portability Contract (No Inline Colors & No Opacity Modifiers)**: 
Remove all hardcoded Tailwind color utilities from the JSX. Map all CSS variables (e.g., `--bg-card`, `--text-primary`) in `tailwind.config.ts` as named tokens so you can use standard Tailwind classes like `bg-card` or `text-primary` **without** arbitrary bracket values. **The one canonical pattern is: define the variable in `globals.css`, map it in `tailwind.config.ts`, and use the Tailwind class name (e.g., `bg-card`) in JSX. Never use `bg-[var(--bg-card)]` or `bg-[#1A1A2E]` directly in JSX.**
**CRITICAL:** Do NOT use opacity modifiers on semantic backgrounds (e.g., NEVER use `bg-success/10` or `bg-danger/5`). These destroy WCAG contrast and Dark/Light mode scaling. Instead, use the exact semantic variant, such as `bg-success-bg` or `bg-danger-bg`. Furthermore, anytime you use a solid background like `bg-success`, you MUST explicitly pair it with `text-on-success` so it doesn't default to unreadable text.
- **Theme Portability Contract:** Every module must have a small `[moduleName]_theme_contract.md` or a dedicated comment listing exactly which CSS variables it depends on (e.g., `--bg-card`, `--text-primary`, `--danger-text`, `--danger-bg`). This ensures that when copying the module into a new project, we know exactly what variables need to be defined in the new `globals.css`.

## 4A. Module Portability Contract

A module is considered AI-portable only when all feature-specific artifacts are owned by that module.

The module should contain:

- UI
- Components
- Hooks
- State
- API clients
- Types
- Schemas
- Constants
- Utilities
- Tests
- Mock fixtures
- MSW handlers
- Feature documentation
- Forbidden documentation
- Theme contract

External dependencies must be limited to approved global infrastructure.

The module's feature documentation MUST explicitly list every unavoidable external infrastructure dependency.

The goal is:

"Give the AI the module folder first.
Only provide external infrastructure files when the documented repair actually requires them."


5. **Smart & Isolated State Management (The Canonical Decision Boundary)**: 
Because the components will be heavily micro-modularized, avoid creating a massive web of prop drilling. Do NOT bloat the global app state; keep the state architecture isolated to the feature.
**The Canonical Decision Boundary:**
- **React Context:** Context is allowed only for stable cross-tree application concerns that are not server-state ownership, such as theme, locale, session shell, or feature flags. Never put API data or loading states in Context. You MUST implement proper memoization (`useMemo`, `useCallback`) to prevent massive re-render chains.
- **Zustand (module-scoped store):** For UI-only shared state within a module (active filters, selected rows, wizard progress, table column preferences, local draft state). Do NOT store API response data or loading states here — see Rule 15C for the canonical Server State vs Client State decision matrix (TanStack Query is the single source of truth for all server/async data).
- **Local `useState`:** Only for state that is strictly private to a single component and never needs to be shared.

6. **Separation of Logic and UI (Custom Hooks for Extreme Isolation)**: 
Do not mix complex React logic (`useEffect`, multi-step state calculations, data transformations) with JSX markup.
Extract all heavy logic into an adjacent custom hook file (e.g., `use[ComponentName].ts`). The actual `.tsx` file should act purely as a "View" layer that consumes the hook.
*Why?* If there is a bug in the calculation logic, you feed the AI only the `use...` file. It fixes the logic with zero risk of accidentally deleting a `<div>` or altering the UI structure.

7. **Interface & Type Isolation (The Prop Blueprint)**: 
Never define complex `Interfaces` or `Types` directly inside the component files. Extract all TypeScript definitions (Component Props, API Payloads, State Shapes) into a dedicated `[moduleName]_types.ts` file or folder.
- **No Inline String Type Unions:** Never hardcode string type unions or any values as string literals (e.g., `'idle' | 'loading' | 'success' | 'error'`) inline inside interfaces or hook declarations. Always extract these into a named type inside the module's `_constants.ts` or `_types.ts` file.

### TypeScript Strictness and Runtime Contract Validation

The project MUST enforce the following `tsconfig.json` settings:

```json
{
  "strict": true,
  "noImplicitAny": true,
  "strictNullChecks": true,
  "noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true,
  "verbatimModuleSyntax": true
}
```

Rules:
- `any` is strictly forbidden. Use `unknown` and narrow it safely.
- `@ts-ignore` and `@ts-nocheck` are forbidden.
- All API response payloads must be validated at the API boundary using Zod before application code consumes them.
- Prefer backend-generated OpenAPI types where an OpenAPI/Swagger contract exists.
- Generated API types must remain separate from domain/UI types.

Recommended structure:
```text
[moduleName]_types/
  ManagerMembersApiGenerated.ts
  [moduleName].schema.ts
  [moduleName].types.ts
```

8. **Strict Server vs. Client Component Boundaries (Next.js Specific)**: 
Respect the Next.js App Router architecture. `page.tsx` and `layout.tsx` MUST remain Server Components unless a documented framework exception exists.
For data-driven interactive modules using TanStack Query + MSW, prefer the module API client/query layer as the canonical data access path.
Server-side prefetching/hydration MAY be used when explicitly implemented. When the backend is unavailable, server-side prefetch/hydration MUST either be disabled for that feature or use an explicitly documented server-compatible mock transport. Browser MSW remains the standard frontend/client test transport. The module API contract and query key MUST remain identical in either path.
Do not create separate server-only and client-only data contracts for the same feature.

### Server Data vs Client Data Rule

Use Server Components for:
- Initial page-level data required to render the route.
- Secure server-only operations. (See Rule 15C for server state policy).
- SEO-relevant content.
- Reading server-only environment variables.

Use Client Components for:
- Forms, filters, live search, table interactions, modals, dropdowns, charts, and browser APIs.
- Client-side mutation workflows.
- WebSocket-driven UI updates.

Do not duplicate the same endpoint fetch in both `page.tsx` and a client hook without an explicit hydration strategy.

If initial server data is passed into a Client Component:
- Document the query key.
- Hydrate/cache it through the approved server-state library.
- Avoid maintaining an unrelated duplicate local state copy.

9. **Leverage Next.js Native Features & Typed Error Boundaries**: 
Ensure that the module properly utilizes Next.js native routing features for a great user experience.
- **Top Routing Progress:** Every Next.js route transition MUST trigger a top progress bar (`nextjs-toploader`) to indicate background navigation. Color: `--primary`.
- **`loading.tsx` (Skeleton UI):** You MUST extract loading states into a `loading.tsx` file wherever applicable in the module's directory. Never use a generic spinning circle for a full page load. Instead, design a premium Skeleton UI that mimics the actual layout of the page (using `bg-skeleton-base` and `bg-skeleton-highlight`).
- **`error.tsx` (Error Boundaries):** Beyond the global `error.tsx`, every module must have a typed React Error Boundary component (`[ModuleName]ErrorBoundary.tsx` or a standard Next.js `error.tsx`) that serves as the route-segment error boundary. It must display a module-specific fallback UI matching the app shell (not a generic "Something went wrong" browser error) and include a primary "Retry" button that calls `reset()`.

### Granular Error Boundary and Error Reporting Rules

Route-level `error.tsx` is mandatory but not enough.

Section Error Boundaries protect against render/component/runtime failures. TanStack Query request failures should use inline section error UI unless the query is explicitly configured to throw into the Error Boundary. Every independently loaded or independently fetched UI section must be wrapped in a section-level Error Boundary where failure should not crash the entire route.

Examples:
- Dashboard chart
- Analytics widget
- Data table
- Payment summary panel
- WebSocket activity feed

Requirements:
- Use a standard shared `ErrorBoundary` implementation.
- Display a module-specific fallback matching the global design system.
- Provide a Retry action where retrying is meaningful.
- Never expose raw stack traces, backend errors, tokens, or internal error details to users.
- Log caught errors to the approved monitoring provider with:
  - route
  - module name
  - user ID if safely available
  - error digest / request ID
  - timestamp

Error fallback hierarchy:
1. Component/section boundary
2. Module-level boundary
3. Route-level `error.tsx`
4. Global application boundary
- **`not-found.tsx` (404 Handling):** Handle missing dynamic routes gracefully by defining a `not-found.tsx` file. It should be beautifully branded and offer a clear "Back to Dashboard" button.

10. **Absolute Imports Only (No Relative Paths)**: 
Never use relative imports (like `../../` or `./`) for importing components, contexts, utilities, or types. Always use absolute imports starting with `@/` (e.g., `@/app/superadmin/gyms/gyms_context/GymsContext`).
*Why?* This allows files to be moved around easily without breaking import paths and makes it much easier to copy-paste code snippets or have an AI generate standalone code without worrying about relative directory depth.

11. **Centralized URL Configuration (No Hardcoded URLs)**: 
Never hardcode URLs (e.g., `/api/auth/refresh`, `/login`, etc.) directly into API wrappers or React components. Each module must have exactly one centralized URL configuration file, named exactly `[moduleName]_url_config.ts` (e.g., `auth_url_config.ts`). This file must export all internal page routes and external API routes used by that module as named constants. Module-owned API/navigation call sites MUST use their module URL config. Global infrastructure may receive a fully constructed path/URL as an argument and MUST NOT own module-specific URLs.

12. **No Hardcoded HTTP Status Codes**: 
Never hardcode numeric HTTP status codes (e.g., `401`, `500`, `200`) in API routes, proxies, or fetch wrappers. Always use standard enums/constants from libraries like `http-status-codes` (e.g., `StatusCodes.UNAUTHORIZED`). This improves code readability and prevents silly typos in status codes.

## AI Context Isolation Contract

The FEATURE MODULE is the canonical AI context boundary.

For a feature-specific task, the AI MUST begin with the owning feature folder and MUST NOT automatically expand context to the role container or application.

Example:

```text
Bug:
Billing invoice filter is broken

Preferred AI context:

/billing/
```

NOT:

```text
/admin/
/manager/
/superadmin/
```

and NOT the entire application.

The AI may expand context only when:

1. the feature's documentation explicitly identifies an external application-infrastructure dependency;
2. the dependency is genuinely infrastructure rather than business behavior;
3. the feature cannot be correctly repaired without inspecting that dependency.

The AI MUST NOT expand context merely because another feature contains similar code.

---

### FEATURE-TO-FEATURE BUSINESS DEPENDENCY FIREWALL

Every feature module is an independent business boundary.

Sibling feature modules MUST be treated as isolated business systems even when they exist under the same role container.

For example:

```text
/admin/members/
/admin/billing/
/admin/reports/
```

are independent business modules.

Therefore:

```text
members → billing business logic       FORBIDDEN
billing → members business logic       FORBIDDEN
reports → billing business logic       FORBIDDEN
```

The same rule applies to all roles and all application areas.

A feature MUST NOT import business behavior from:

* sibling feature components
* sibling feature hooks
* sibling feature stores
* sibling feature contexts
* sibling feature API services
* sibling feature types
* sibling feature schemas
* sibling feature constants
* sibling feature utilities
* sibling feature fixtures
* sibling feature MSW handlers
* sibling feature tests
* role-level business folders
* another role's feature modules

---

### Allowed External Dependencies

A feature MAY depend on:

* framework packages
* third-party packages
* approved application infrastructure
* genuinely generic zero-business-logic UI primitives
* explicitly documented framework/application bootstrap mechanisms

These dependencies MUST be stable infrastructure contracts.

A feature MUST NOT treat another business feature as infrastructure.

---

### LOCAL OWNERSHIP OVER CROSS-FEATURE REUSE

When a feature requires business behavior similar to another feature, the default action is to implement or duplicate the required feature-specific behavior locally.

Do NOT create:

```text
global business utils
global business hooks
global business components
global business API services
global role-wide domain types
global role-wide fixtures
```

merely to avoid duplication.

If extracting shared code would create hidden business coupling or increase AI context requirements, prefer local duplication.

### AI Change Scope Integrity Gate

AI MUST produce a changed-file list and MUST fail the task if files outside the owning module changed unexpectedly, except approved global infrastructure files explicitly listed in the module feature map.

### HARD FEATURE WRITE BOUNDARY

For a feature-specific repair, the default writable scope is:

```text
[owning-feature]/**
```

The AI MUST NOT modify sibling business features or unrelated application code.

Example:

```text
Task:
Fix bug in `/admin/billing/`

Allowed by default:

/admin/billing/**
```

Not allowed:

```text
/admin/members/**
/admin/reports/**
/superadmin/**
/manager/**
```

even if those modules contain similar code.

If a feature-local bug appears to require another business feature to be changed, the AI MUST NOT silently modify that other feature.

Instead, the AI MUST first determine whether:

1. the dependency should be moved into the owning feature;
2. the required behavior should be duplicated locally;
3. the dependency is actually application infrastructure;
4. the issue is outside the feature's documented scope.

Normal feature repairs should end with changes contained within the owning feature.

---

### CHANGE SCOPE FAILURE CONDITION

A feature repair FAILS the architecture gate when the AI:

* changes an unrelated business module;
* creates a new sibling-feature dependency;
* moves feature business logic into a role-level folder;
* creates a new global business helper merely to solve the local bug;
* imports another feature's business fixtures;
* modifies another feature's mock handlers;
* modifies unrelated feature state;
* changes unrelated routes without documented necessity.

The AI MUST report the complete changed-file list at the end of the task.

The expected normal result is:

```text
Changed files:
[feature]/**
```

with only documented application-infrastructure changes allowed as exceptions.

13. **Update AI-Context Documentation (The Feature Map)**:
Once the entire refactor is complete, generate or update a `[moduleName]_features.md` documentation file inside the module's root folder. This document MUST serve as a master map for future AI sessions and human developers. A future AI reading only this file must be able to answer: What does this module do? What can the user do in it? What files handle what? What are the API endpoints? What must never be broken?

### The Documentation Quality Standard

**CRITICAL — The difference between useful and useless documentation:**

❌ **BAD (what AI agents produce by default — completely useless):**
```
## Module Purpose
Handles gyms operations, UI display, and logic isolation.

## Feature Inventory
| Core UI | /gyms | Main module view | TBD | Frontend Team |

## Edge Cases / AI Warnings
- Do not bypass API interceptors.
- Do not mix complex React logic with JSX markup.
```

✅ **GOOD (what this rule mandates — gives full context to any AI or human):**
```
## Module Purpose
The Gyms module is the master tenant registry for the GymSmart SaaS platform. Superadmins
use it to onboard new gym branches, view all active/suspended tenants, manage their
subscription tier, and drill into per-gym usage metrics. It is the entry point for all
tenant lifecycle operations (create → activate → suspend → delete).

## Feature Inventory
| Gym List        | /superadmin/gyms          | Paginated table of all tenants with status badges, search, and filter by plan/status | GET /superadmin/gyms?page&limit&search&status | ✅ Live |
| Add Gym         | /superadmin/gyms/add      | Multi-step onboarding form: gym details → owner account → plan selection → confirm   | POST /superadmin/gyms                         | ✅ Live |
| Gym Detail      | /superadmin/gyms/[id]     | Full profile: contact info, subscription history, usage stats, staff count           | GET /superadmin/gyms/:id                      | ✅ Live |
| Suspend/Restore | /superadmin/gyms (inline) | Toggle gym active status — requires double-confirm modal                             | PATCH /superadmin/gyms/:id/status             | ✅ Live |

## Edge Cases / AI Warnings
- Suspending a gym immediately blocks ALL users of that tenant from logging in — this is
  irreversible until manually restored. Always use useConfirm() with a typed warning message.
- The Add Gym form is a 3-step wizard. Step 3 (plan selection) fetches live plan data from
  GET /superadmin/plans — do NOT hardcode plan options.
- Gym IDs are UUIDs, not sequential integers. Never use array index as a key.
- The status badge color mapping lives in SuperadminGymsConstants.ts — do not inline colors.
```

The rule is simple: **if a section contains "TBD", "Main module view", "Do not bypass API interceptors", or any other generic filler, the documentation FAILS this rule and must be rewritten.**

### Mandatory `[moduleName]_features.md` Template with Content Requirements

Every module feature map MUST use this structure. Each section has mandatory content depth requirements listed below it.

```markdown
# [Module Name] — Feature Map

## Module Purpose
[REQUIRED: 3–6 sentences. Must answer: (1) What business problem does this module solve?
(2) Who uses it (which role/persona)? (3) What are the 3–5 most important things a user
can DO in this module? (4) What is strictly OFF-LIMITS for this role in this module?
Generic phrases like "handles X operations" are forbidden.]

## Directory Structure
[REQUIRED: A table or bullet list of EVERY folder inside this module with a one-line
description of its exact responsibility. Must name the actual files/components inside
each folder, not just the folder name. Example:]

| Folder | Responsibility | Key Files |
|---|---|---|
| `members_components/ManagerMembersTable/` | Renders the paginated member list table with search, filter, and row-click navigation | `ManagerMembersTable.tsx`, `ManagerMembersTableRow.tsx`, `ManagerMembersTableHeaders.ts` |
| `members_components/ManagerMembersProfile/` | Full member profile modal: personal info, membership history, payment records, diet/workout assignment | `ManagerMembersProfileModal.tsx`, `ManagerMembersProfileTabs.tsx` |
| `members_api/` | All API calls for member CRUD, renewal, payment recording | `ManagerMembersApi.ts`, `manager_members_url_config.ts` |
| `members_types/` | TypeScript interfaces for Member, MembershipRecord, PaymentRecord, form DTOs | `ManagerMembersTypes.ts` |
| `members_store/` | Zustand store for selected member ID, active tab, filter state | `useManagerMembersStore.ts` |
| `members_context/` | React Context bridging store state to deeply nested components | `ManagerMembersContext.tsx`, `ManagerMembersProvider.tsx` |
| `members_mocks/handlers/` | Module-specific MSW handlers for member endpoints | `ManagerMembersMockHandlers.ts` |
| `members_mocks/fixtures/` | Complete mock API datasets used by the member handlers | `ManagerMembersMockFixtures.ts` |

### Approved External Dependencies

This section MUST contain an explicit inventory of everything outside the feature module that the feature imports or relies upon.

Example:

```text
## Approved External Dependencies

### Application Infrastructure
- `@/lib/api` — global HTTP transport only
- `@/lib/logger` — application logging infrastructure
- `@/components/ui/Dialog` — zero-business-logic dialog primitive

### Business Feature Dependencies
- None

### Role-Level Business Dependencies
- None
```

A feature that has no external business dependency MUST explicitly say:

```text
Business Feature Dependencies:
- None

Role-Level Business Dependencies:
- None
```

This is mandatory.

The AI MUST use this section as the dependency allowlist during future repairs.

If a new external dependency is introduced, the feature documentation MUST be updated in the same change.

## Feature Inventory
[REQUIRED: Every distinct user-facing feature gets its own row. "Core UI" is NOT a feature.
Each row must have a real Purpose description (what the user actually does), real API
endpoints (not "TBD"), and an accurate Status. Minimum 1 row per meaningful UI section.]

| Feature | Route | What the User Can Do | Key Components | Main API Calls | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## User Flows & Interactions
[REQUIRED: Describe the 2–4 most important multi-step user journeys in this module.
Format: numbered steps. This section is what lets an AI understand the full flow
without reading every component file. Example:]

### Flow 1: Add New Member
1. User clicks "Add Member" button in `ManagerMembersMain` toolbar
2. `ManagerMembersAddModal` opens (managed by `useManagerMembersStore.openAddModal`)
3. User fills 3-tab form: Personal Info → Membership Plan → Payment
4. On submit, `createMember(dto)` is called from `ManagerMembersApi.ts`
5. On success: reconcile/invalidate the relevant TanStack Query cache using the authoritative backend response, modal closes, toast shows backend message
6. On error: form preserves entered data, inline error shown from `res.message`

### Flow 2: Renew Membership
1. User clicks any member row → `ManagerMembersProfileModal` opens
2. User navigates to "Membership" tab → clicks "Renew"
3. `ManagerMembersRenewalModal` opens with pre-filled current plan
4. On confirm: `renewMembership(memberId, dto)` called → Query cache invalidated/updated → toast shown

## Data and State Architecture
[REQUIRED: Must name the ACTUAL store files, context files, and query keys — not "TBD".]

- **State pattern:** [e.g., "TanStack Query for server state + Zustand for UI state. React Context for cross-tree bridging."]
- **Zustand stores:** [List actual store files and what state they hold, e.g., `useManagerMembersStore.ts` — holds: selectedMemberId, isAddModalOpen, isEditModalOpen, activeProfileTab, searchQuery, statusFilter, currentPage]
- **Context providers:** [List actual provider files, e.g., `MembersProvider` in `ManagerMembersContext.tsx` — wraps `ManagerMembersMain`, provides store values to `ManagerMembersTable` and `ManagerMembersProfileModal`]
- **Local-storage keys:** ["None" is a valid answer if accurate]
- **MSW handler location:** [actual module-owned handler file]
- **MSW fixture location:** [actual module-owned fixture file]
- **MSW global bootstrap:** [actual global registration/bootstrap file, if applicable]
- **MSW scenarios:** [normal / empty / error / filter / sort / pagination / permission-denied, as applicable]

## API Contract
[REQUIRED: Every API function in the module's API file must be listed with its exact
HTTP method, endpoint, request shape, and response type. "List all endpoint builders"
is not acceptable — actually list them.]

All calls go through `apiFetch` at `@/lib/api`. Response envelope: `{ success: boolean, message: string, data: T | null, meta?: PaginationMeta, error?: string, errorCode?: string, statusCode?: number, validationErrors?: ValidationErrorItem[] }`

| Function | Method | Endpoint | Request | Response `data` type |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `fetchMembers(params)` | GET | `/manager/members` | `{ page, limit, search, status }` | `Member[]` + `PaginationMeta` |
| `fetchMemberById(id)` | GET | `/manager/members/:id` | — | `MemberDetail` |
| `createMember(dto)` | POST | `/manager/members` | `CreateMemberDto` | `Member` |
| `updateMember(id, dto)` | PATCH | `/manager/members/:id` | `UpdateMemberDto` | `Member` |
| `deleteMember(id)` | DELETE | `/manager/members/:id` | — | `null` |
| `renewMembership(id, dto)` | POST | `/manager/members/:id/renew` | `RenewalDto` | `MembershipRecord` |

## UI Data Requirements
[REQUIRED: List every table column, KPI, chart series, filter, dropdown, detail field,
and other data-driven UI element with its exact API response field. This section is the
source used to verify MSW fixture completeness. No UI element may be left unlisted.
Generic entries like "All fields" are forbidden — name every column and field explicitly.]

| UI Element | Required Field(s) | API Endpoint | Response Path | Nullable? | Mocked? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Table: Member Name | `name` | `GET /manager/members` | `data.items[].name` | No | Yes |
| Table: Status Badge | `status` | `GET /manager/members` | `data.items[].status` | No | Yes |
| KPI: Total Members | `totalCount` | `GET /manager/members/stats` | `data.totalCount` | No | Yes |
| Filter: Status | `status` | `GET /manager/members` | `data.items[].status` | No | Yes |

*(Replace the example rows above with the real field names, endpoint names, and response
paths for this specific module. Every rendered UI element must have a row here.)*

## Permissions and Security
[REQUIRED: Must specify the exact role, what actions are protected, and HOW they are
protected (which hook/component/guard). Generic statements are not acceptable.]

- **Required role:** [e.g., `MANAGER` — enforced by `middleware.ts` checking `gymsmart_token` cookie]
- **Destructive actions and their guards:** [e.g., "Delete member → `useConfirm()` from `ManagerConfirmProvider` with message 'This will permanently delete the member and all their records.'"]
- **Sensitive data handling:** [e.g., "Phone numbers masked via `maskSensitiveData()` in list view. Full number visible only in profile modal."]
- **Cross-role isolation:** [e.g., "Zero imports from `/admin`, `/trainer`, `/superadmin`. Enforced in `members_forbidden.md`."]
- **CODEOWNERS:** [e.g., "No payment/auth logic in this module — standard review applies."]

## Loading, Empty, and Error States
[REQUIRED: For every major UI section, name the exact file/component that handles each
state. "Uses loading.tsx skeleton" is not enough — describe what the skeleton looks like.]

| Section | Loading State | Empty State | Error State |
|---|---|---|---|
| Full page | `loading.tsx` — skeleton mimicking toolbar + 8 KPI cards + table with 5 ghost rows | N/A | `error.tsx` — module-branded error with Retry button calling `reset()` |
| Members table | table-shaped skeleton matching rows/columns while the TanStack Query request is pending/fetching | `ManagerMembersEmptyState.tsx` — icon + "No members found" + "Add Member" CTA button | Inline error banner with retry link |
| Profile modal | Skeleton tabs + ghost text lines | N/A | Inline "Failed to load profile" with retry |

## Edge Cases and AI Warnings
[REQUIRED: This is the most important section for AI safety. Must list SPECIFIC risks
for THIS module — not generic advice. Every item must be actionable. Minimum 5 items
for any module with CRUD operations. Format: bold warning title + explanation.]

- **[Specific warning title]:** [Specific explanation of what breaks, why, and what to do instead]

Examples of REQUIRED specificity:
- **Never call `window.confirm()` for member deletion:** Always use `useConfirm()` from `ManagerConfirmProvider`. `window.confirm()` is blocked by most browsers in iframes and breaks the design system.
- **Renewal form pre-fills current plan — do not reset on open:** `ManagerMembersRenewalModal` receives `currentPlan` as a prop and pre-fills the plan selector. If you reset the form on modal open, the user loses context.
- **`deleteMember` removes ALL membership history:** This is irreversible. The confirm dialog must explicitly state this. Do not soften the warning message.
- **Member status badge colors are defined in `ManagerMembersConstants.ts`:** Never add inline color classes for status. Add new statuses to the constants map.
- **Phone number masking applies to list view only:** `ManagerMembersTable` uses `maskSensitiveData()`. `ManagerMembersProfileModal` shows the full number. Do not add masking to the profile modal.

## Component Responsibility Map
[REQUIRED for modules with 5+ components. Lists every component file with a one-line
responsibility statement. This lets an AI know exactly which file to open for any task
without reading all files.]

| Component File | Responsibility |
|---|---|
| `ManagerMembersMain.tsx` | Root client orchestrator. Owns layout, renders toolbar + KPIs + table. No direct API calls. |
| `ManagerMembersTable.tsx` | Renders paginated member rows. Handles row-click → opens profile modal. |
| `ManagerMembersProfileModal.tsx` | Full member detail modal with tabs. Receives `memberId` prop, renders profile using query-hook-provided data. |
| `ManagerMembersAddModal.tsx` | 3-tab add member form. Renders form and delegates submission to form/mutation hook. Closes on success. |
| `ManagerMembersKPIs.tsx` | 4 stat cards (Total, Active, Expired, Due Today). Read-only display. |
| `ManagerMembersEmptyState.tsx` | Empty state UI shown when table has zero rows. Has "Add Member" CTA. |

```

### Sub-Module `[feature]_features.md` Files

For large modules (5+ sub-features), each sub-folder MAY have its own `[feature]_features.md`. These sub-module files follow the same quality standard but can be shorter. They MUST still contain:
- A real Module Purpose (not "handles X operations")
- A real Feature Inventory with actual API endpoints
- A real Edge Cases section with module-specific warnings (minimum 3 items)
- A Component Responsibility Map

Sub-module files with only generic boilerplate content are considered **undocumented** and must be regenerated.

### Documentation Freshness Rule

Every time a component is added, an API endpoint changes, or a new user flow is implemented, the `_features.md` for that module MUST be updated in the same commit. Stale documentation is worse than no documentation because it actively misleads future AI agents.

14. **Backend-Driven UI Messages (No Hardcoded Toasts/Alerts)**: 
Never hardcode success or error messages (e.g., "User created successfully" or "Invalid credentials") in the frontend components, hooks, or toast notifications. The frontend must strictly display the `message` string provided by the backend's standardized JSON response envelope.

15. **Performance & Optimization Architecture**:
- **Debounce API Calls**: Any search input or filter that triggers backend API calls MUST be debounced (e.g., using a custom `useDebounce` hook or a library like `lodash.debounce`) with at least a 300ms delay.
- **Server-Side Pagination & Filtering**: For server-backed, user-browsable datasets where pagination, sorting, or filtering is applicable, use server-side pagination, sorting, and filtering. Do not fetch large datasets merely to simulate these behaviors on the client.
- **Lazy Loading & Suspense**: For heavy components that are not immediately visible on initial load, use React's `lazy()` or Next.js `next/dynamic` to code-split them.
- **Strict Memoization for Contexts**: If using Context, ensure Provider values are strictly memoized using `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
- **Mutation Source of Truth:** TanStack Query cache is the source of truth for server data. Optimistic updates MAY be used for safe, reversible, non-financial operations when explicitly justified. Optimistic updates are FORBIDDEN for destructive, irreversible, permission-sensitive, and financial operations. Successful mutations MUST reconcile the Query cache with the authoritative backend response. Zustand MUST NOT be used as the primary server-data store.

### Additional Performance Requirements

- Use `next/image` for all content images. Raw `<img>` tags are forbidden unless there is a documented technical exception.
- Above-the-fold images must have explicit dimensions and appropriate priority behavior.
- Heavy charts, editors, maps, PDF viewers, and rich media components must use dynamic import/code splitting.
- Every asynchronous data section must show a skeleton matching its final layout.
- Use a spinner only for short button-level loading states.
- Do not apply `React.memo`, `useMemo`, or `useCallback` blindly.
  - Use `React.memo` only for frequently re-rendering presentational children.
  - Use `useMemo` only for measurably expensive calculations.
  - Use `useCallback` only when necessary for memoized child props or dependency stability.
- Bundle impact must be checked for large dependency additions or major feature releases.
- Avoid importing full libraries where tree-shakable or lighter alternatives exist.


15A. **Mandatory Testing Architecture**:
AI-generated code is not considered complete until the required tests exist.

Approved stack:
- Unit tests: Vitest
- React component tests: React Testing Library
- E2E tests: Playwright
- API/network mocking: MSW

Co-location rule (Unit & Component Tests ONLY):
- ManagerMembersTable.tsx → ManagerMembersTable.test.tsx
- useManagerMembersTable.ts → useManagerMembersTable.test.ts
- ManagerMembersFormatting.ts → ManagerMembersFormatting.test.ts

**Complete Isolation for E2E Testing (The AI Zip Principle):**
1. **Top-Level Mirrored Folders:** All E2E tests MUST live in a completely separate top-level `frontend_e2e/` directory, entirely decoupled from the `src/` app folder. The internal directory structure of `frontend_e2e/` MUST strictly mirror the frontend route structure (e.g., `frontend_e2e/frontend_admin_e2e/members/members.spec.ts`).
2. **WET Over DRY (Module-Level):** Frontend E2E tests must be 100% self-contained at the **MODULE level**. Do NOT create a global `shared/` or `utils/` folder for E2E. If both the `members` test and `billing` test need a login helper, duplicate it directly into BOTH the `members` and `billing` test folders.
   - **Why:** If a UI bug occurs in the Members feature, a developer must be able to ZIP only the `frontend_e2e/frontend_admin_e2e/members/` folder and feed it to the AI. If the AI is missing parent helpers, it hallucinate.
3. **No Cross-Module Imports:** A test script in `frontend_manager_e2e/members/` MUST NOT import a fixture or helper from `frontend_manager_e2e/billing/`.

Minimum expectations:
- Utilities: 90% branch coverage
- Custom hooks: 80% coverage
- Core components: interaction tests for all user events (clicks, typing, dropdowns), loading, success, empty, error, and disabled states.

**Component Testing Philosophy (No Playwright):**
1. **Co-located Unit & Component Tests (Vitest/RTL):** MUST live directly inside the feature module folder as shown above.
2. **No Frontend E2E Suite:** Because true E2E is handled externally (e.g., Selenium via the backend QA pipeline), the frontend is responsible strictly for rigorous **Component Integration Testing**. You MUST use React Testing Library (RTL) + MSW to verify that:
   - Buttons trigger the correct actions and loading states.
   - Dropdowns open and select the correct values.
   - Modals appear and close correctly.
   - Component empty, error, and success states render properly.


   - Core components: interaction tests for loading, success, empty, error, and disabled states
- Critical journeys: Playwright E2E coverage

Mandatory E2E flows:
- Login/logout/session expiry
- Permission-denied states
- Create/edit/delete workflows
- Type-to-confirm destructive action flows
- Billing or payment workflows
- Important table filtering, pagination, and export workflows


Testing rules:
- Test user-visible behavior, not internal implementation details.
- Do not use snapshots for dynamic, complex UI as a substitute for assertions.
- Reuse Module-Owned MSW handlers in unit/component tests.
- A bug fix must include a regression test if reasonably testable.

### AI Test Integrity Gate

A test file existing is NOT sufficient evidence that the feature is actually tested.

AI-generated tests MUST verify real behavior and MUST NOT be created merely to
satisfy coverage or checklist requirements.

The AI MUST NOT satisfy testing requirements with:
- Placeholder assertions such as `expect(true).toBe(true)` or `expect(1).toBe(1)`.
- Empty test bodies.
- Tests that only render/mount a component without asserting meaningful behavior.
- Snapshot-only tests for dynamic business UI.
- Assertions against implementation details when user-visible behavior can be asserted.
- Tests that mock away the exact behavior the feature is supposed to prove.
- Tests that pass only because the expected value is copied from the implementation
  rather than the documented requirement.
- Tests that bypass the real feature API path when API behavior is part of the requirement.

For every non-trivial data-driven feature, tests MUST verify, where applicable:

1. API-driven data reaches the UI through the real feature API layer.
2. Every documented UI Data Requirement renders from the response contract (Rule 75D).
3. Loading state renders correctly.
4. Empty state can actually be triggered.
5. Error state can actually be triggered.
6. Search/filter/sort/pagination behavior changes the request or rendered result appropriately.
7. Form validation and submission behavior work through the real feature flow.
8. Mutation success uses the backend response as the source of truth.
9. Backend `message` is surfaced correctly where required (Rule 14).
10. Security/permission-denied UI behaves correctly.
11. Regression tests exist for bug fixes whenever the behavior is testable.

A passing test suite is NOT accepted as proof of correctness if the tests themselves
are meaningless.

**AI completion gate:**
- Read the test code.
- Identify what real behavior each test proves.
- Confirm each critical requirement has at least one meaningful assertion.
- Reject tests that would still pass if the actual feature behavior were broken.

15B. **Form Management, Validation, and Submission Architecture**:
All non-trivial forms MUST use:
- React Hook Form
- Zod
- `@hookform/resolvers`

Form structure:
```text
[Feature]Form/
  [Feature]Form.tsx
  use[Feature]Form.ts
  [Feature]Schema.ts
  [Feature]Form.test.tsx
```

Responsibilities:
- Form component: layout and field composition only.
- Custom form hook: form setup, submit orchestration, mutation state.
- Zod schema: validation and typed input/output contract.
- API layer: request/response communication only.

Validation rules:
- Validate client-side for immediate UX.
- Backend remains the final authority for validation.
- Display field validation errors inline below fields.
- Display backend response `message` for server-level errors as per Rule 14.
- Never show raw API error objects to users.

Submission rules:
- Disable submit button while the request is pending.
- Prevent duplicate submission.
- Reset only after confirmed successful response.
- Preserve entered data after failed requests unless product requirements say otherwise.
- All destructive form actions must follow the global Type-to-Confirm design rule.

File upload rules:
- Validate MIME type, extension, and max file size before upload.
- Show upload progress where supported.
- Never trust client validation alone; backend validation remains mandatory.

15C. **State Management Decision Matrix**:
State must be placed according to its ownership and lifecycle.

1. **Server State — TanStack Query / React Query**
Use for:
- API responses
- Loading/error states from APIs
- Caching
- Pagination
- Background refetching
- Mutations and invalidation

Rules:
- Backend data MUST NOT be stored as the primary source of truth in Zustand or Context.
- Every query key must be namespaced by module:
  `['members', 'list', filters]`
  `['members', 'detail', memberId]`
- After mutations, invalidate or update the relevant query cache intentionally.
- Do not refetch the whole application after a small mutation.

2. **Zustand — Module-Level Shared Client State**
Use for:
- Active filter UI state
- Selected rows
- Table column preferences
- Multi-step wizard progress
- Local draft state shared by multiple client components

Rules:
- Stores should remain module-scoped.
- Avoid one giant global store.
- Do not put API response data into a Zustand store unless there is a documented offline/realtime requirement.

3. **React Context**
Use only for stable cross-tree concerns:
- Theme
- Locale
- Auth session shell
- App-wide feature flags

4. **Local State**
Use `useState` or `useReducer` for component-private UI state:
- Modal open/close
- Input visibility
- Hover/focus state
- Local tab selection

Before creating a new global state container, document why local state, props, URL parameters, or React Query cannot solve the need.

15D. **Environment Variable and Runtime Configuration Management**:
Required files:
- `.env.example` — committed; contains every required key with empty/sample values.
- `.env.local` — local secrets; never committed.
- `.env.development` — non-secret development configuration where needed.
- `.env.production` — non-secret production configuration where platform policy permits.

Rules:
- Variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` are public browser-visible values.
- Never place secrets, private API keys, database URLs, token signing keys, or payment secrets in `NEXT_PUBLIC_` variables.
- Do not access `process.env` directly from arbitrary components/hooks.
- Validate environment variables in one central configuration module using Zod.
- Fail fast at startup if required configuration is missing or malformed.
- Document every environment variable in `.env.example`.

Recommended structure:
```text
src/config/env.ts
src/config/app-config.ts
```

15E. **Frontend Observability and Diagnostics**:
Production frontend errors must be observable without exposing sensitive information to users.

Requirements:
- Integrate an approved error-monitoring solution.
- Capture route, module, anonymized user/session context where allowed, request ID, and error digest.
- Never send passwords, tokens, full payment data, or sensitive personal data in logs.
- Use structured frontend events for critical business workflows:
  - login failure
  - payment failure
  - failed export
  - destructive action failure
  - repeated API error
- All application diagnostics must use the centralized logger. `console.log` is forbidden in committed code.
- Define an owner and alert policy for critical failures.

16. **Robust Form Handling & Validation**:
For any forms with more than two inputs, strictly avoid using individual `useState` hooks. Use a robust form management library (like **React Hook Form**) paired with a schema validation library (like **Zod**). For non-trivial forms, schema location and structure MUST follow Rule 15B. Do not place form schemas in generic `_utils` folders merely for convenience.

17. **Centralized API Error Interception**:
Global interceptor handles only truly global concerns such as authentication expiry, token refresh, transport normalization, and globally applicable status behavior. Module-specific business errors MUST remain available to the module API/query layer and MUST NOT be swallowed or converted into generic global toasts.

18. **Enterprise Accessibility (a11y)**:
Ensure UI components are accessible. Use semantic HTML, include `aria-label` tags for icon-only buttons, and ensure modals and dropdowns can be navigated via keyboard (Tab trapping, Esc to close).

19. **Interactive Data Tables (Clickable Rows)**:
Whenever displaying a list of entities in a table, the entire row MUST be clickable. Add `cursor-pointer` to the `<tr>` element. Remove redundant "View/Eye" buttons. Action buttons (Edit, Delete) must have `e.stopPropagation()`. A clickable table row MUST provide an equivalent keyboard-accessible interaction. Do not rely on `cursor-pointer` alone. Enter/Space or a semantic link/button MUST provide the same navigation/action. Nested Edit/Delete controls MUST remain independently keyboard accessible.

20. **Searchable Dropdowns for Large Datasets**:
Whenever presenting a dropdown for a large dataset, you MUST NOT use a native HTML `<select>` element. You must implement a custom popover/dropdown component that includes a search `<input>` field at the top.

21. **Real-Time Communication (In-House WebSocket Architecture)**:
For any real-time in-app communication, the project strictly uses an in-house WebSocket architecture. Real-time communication MUST use WebSocket transport through `socket.io-client`. Long-polling transport MUST be disabled by configuration (`transports: ['websocket']`) unless a documented infrastructure exception exists. Do NOT rely on SSE or external managed services like Pusher/Supabase.

22. **Tenant Context & Centralized Headers (Multi-Tenancy)**:
The backend utilizes a strict Database-per-Tenant architecture. The frontend MUST NOT rely on components to manually send tenant info. For tenant-scoped API requests, the centralized API wrapper automatically injects `x-tenant-id`. Platform/global endpoints MUST explicitly opt out according to the API contract. Client-side tenant header injection is convenience/context propagation only and MUST NEVER be treated as an authorization boundary. Backend authorization and tenant isolation remain authoritative.

23. **Password Visibility Toggle**:
Whenever there is a password input field, you MUST include an eye icon (visibility toggle) to switch between `password` and `text`. Use standard icons from lucide-react.

24. **Date & Time Standardization (Timezone Safety)**:
UI/form layers may use typed date values appropriate to the component; serialization to UTC ISO 8601 MUST occur at the module API boundary before the request is sent. When displaying, convert UTC strings to local time using `date-fns` or `dayjs`.

25. **Role-Based UI Hiding (RBAC)**:
Never rely solely on the backend to block unauthorized actions while leaving the action button visible. `usePermissions()` is approved global security/session infrastructure. It may expose role/capability checks, but MUST NOT contain module-specific UI behavior, business workflows, or feature logic. Module-specific permission rules are declared/documented by the owning module and consumed through this global capability interface. Destructive/restricted UI elements MUST be completely hidden or safely disabled.

26. **Skeleton Loaders over Generic Spinners**:
When fetching complex layout data or lists, implement **Skeleton Loaders** (using Tailwind's `animate-pulse` or a library) that mimic the shape of incoming data instead of full-page spinning circles.

27. **Strict TypeScript (No `any` Rule)**:
The use of the `any` type is strictly forbidden. If a payload is unknown, use the `unknown` type and assert/validate safely via Zod. (Mechanically enforced via ESLint, see Rule 61).

28. **Icon-Driven Action Columns**:
Whenever displaying action buttons in data tables/lists, prioritize using semantic icons (e.g., from `lucide-react`) instead of bulky text labels. Include descriptive tooltips and `aria-label`s.

29. **Multi-Medium Sending Selection (Radio Buttons)**:
Whenever the user performs an action that sends a proof/document, present an option to choose between mediums (e.g., WhatsApp vs. Email) using Radio Buttons. Do NOT use checkboxes if only one is to be selected.

30. **Mandatory Table Controls (Pagination, Sorting, & Filtering)**:
Every **user-browsable data table** MUST implement applicable pagination, sorting, and filtering. If a control is not applicable because the dataset is static/small/read-only, the module documentation MUST state why. **Table Header Sorting Indicators:** Any sortable column header MUST include a visible sorting icon (e.g., up/down arrows like `ArrowUpDown`, `ArrowUp`, `ArrowDown` from `lucide-react`). The actively sorted column must highlight the directional arrow (e.g., in a primary/accent color) to clearly indicate the current sort direction.

31. **Modularized API Clients (No Centralized API Blob)**:
Do not define module-specific API routes in a giant global file. Every module MUST have its own API file inside a dedicated folder (e.g., `[moduleName]_api/[moduleName]_api.ts`) importing the core base fetcher.

32. **The "No Barrel File" Rule (Avoid `index.ts`)**:
Strictly avoid using `index.ts` or `index.js` files to re-export modules. Always import directly from the explicitly named file to prevent circular dependencies.

33. **Framework-Specific Media Optimization**:
Make Next.js `<Image>` component (`next/image`) default and mandatory. Permit documented exceptions for third-party controlled markup, emails, SVG assets, or technically incompatible external content where standard `<img>` tags are needed.

34. **Environment Variable Segregation & Security**:
Strictly segregate public and private environment variables. Prefix public variables with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`. Never leak secret keys.

35. **Strict Prohibition of Magic Strings & Numbers**:
Never use raw strings or numbers directly in logic/UI. All magic values must be defined as TypeScript `enums` or `const` objects. (Mechanically enforced via ESLint, see Rule 61).
Magic strings/numbers mean unexplained business/configuration values that affect behavior. Intentional user-facing copy, accessibility text, CSS classes, TypeScript literals, object keys, test descriptions, and mathematically obvious constants are not considered magic values unless they represent business configuration.

36. **No Arbitrary Tailwind Values (Strict Design System)**:
Arbitrary Tailwind values are forbidden by default. Any unavoidable arbitrary value requires an explicit documented exception. Adhere to standard framework scales (e.g., `w-80`). (Mechanically enforced via ESLint, see Rule 61).

37. **JSDoc for Complex Logic (AI Context Enhancer)**:
Every custom hook, utility function, and complex data transformation MUST be prefixed with a short, descriptive JSDoc block detailing its intent.

38. **Strict Component Responsibility Contract**:
Every component file must have a single-line comment at the very top declaring its exact responsibility:
`// RESPONSIBILITY: Renders the read-only member profile header. Receives data via props. No API calls.`
Responsibility comments MUST describe the component's rendering/orchestration responsibility and MUST NOT imply that business/API logic belongs inside the component.

39. **Explicit Data Flow Direction Comments**:
In every Context file and custom hook, document the data flow direction at the top:
`// DATA FLOW: API → useMembersTable.ts → MembersContext → MembersTable`

40. **Forbidden Patterns File (`[moduleName]_forbidden.md`)**:
Every module must have a tiny markdown file listing what is explicitly NOT allowed in that module.

Every module's `[moduleName]_forbidden.md` SHOULD explicitly document:

- Do not place feature mock data outside this module.
- Do not create duplicate global mock handlers for this module.
- Do not import another module's business fixtures.
- Do not add component-level fake business fallbacks.
- Do not bypass the module API client by reading fixtures directly.
- Do not modify global MSW bootstrap for a module-local feature change unless registration is actually required.

41. **URL as State for Shareable Views**:
Any filterable, searchable, or paginated list page MUST sync its state to the URL as query parameters using `useSearchParams` / `useRouter`.

42. **Network State Enum (No Boolean `isLoading` Flags)**:
**Network State Rule:** For TanStack Query requests, MUST use TanStack Query's native typed query/mutation status (`status`, `isPending`, `isFetching`, `isError`, etc.) and MUST NOT recreate a parallel `FetchState` enum. A custom async-state enum is allowed only for non-TanStack-Query asynchronous workflows.

43. **Sensitive Data Masking in UI**:
Any field displaying sensitive data must be masked by default in list views (e.g., `98****2310`). Use a dedicated `maskSensitiveData()` utility.

44. **No `console.log` in Production**:
All `console.log` calls are strictly forbidden in committed code. Use a centralized logger utility (`src/lib/logger.ts`). (Mechanically enforced via ESLint, see Rule 61).

45. **Co-located Test Files**:
Every custom hook and utility function must have a co-located test file (`use[X].test.ts`).

46. **Unsaved Changes Warning**:
Any modified form/modal must intercept `beforeunload` to warn the user: "You have unsaved changes."

47. **Copy-to-Clipboard on Permitted Identifiers**:
Any field displaying a unique, non-sensitive identifier or tracking code may have a small copy icon next to it. **Forbidden from copying:** credentials, OTPs, reset tokens, full Aadhaar/national ID numbers, full bank account numbers, full card numbers, and any other explicitly sensitive secret. These fields must never expose a copy affordance.

48. **Consistent Empty State per Entity**:
Every list/table MUST have a dedicated empty state component (`[Module]EmptyState.tsx`) with an icon and message. Include a CTA when a meaningful user action can resolve the empty state; otherwise the empty state may be informational/read-only.

49. **Strict Import Order Convention**:
Enforce a strict order using ESLint `import/order`: React core, Third-party, Absolute internal (`@/lib`), Module-specific (`@/app/superadmin/gyms/...`), Types-only.

50. **Prop Spreading is Forbidden (`...props` ban)**:
Never write `<Component {...props} />`. All props must be explicitly named, except for primitive HTML wrappers.

51. **Conditional Rendering Pattern (No Inline Ternary Hell)**:
Deeply nested ternaries are forbidden. For 3+ conditions, use an early return pattern or `renderContent()` helper.

52. **Event Handler Naming Convention**:
Props must use the `on` prefix (`onSubmit`), internal handlers use `handle` prefix (`handleSubmit`).

53. **`useEffect` Dependency Array Audit Comment**:
Every non-trivial `useEffect` MUST document why the effect exists and why its dependency set is correct. Trivial effects that are self-evident may omit a comment.

54. **Global Shared Components Strict Scope**:
`src/components/ui/` is ONLY for generic, zero-business-logic primitives. Global components must NEVER contain module-specific API calls.

55. **`key` Prop Rules for Lists**:
Use stable unique keys. For server entities, prefer backend IDs; for static/local collections, use another stable unique domain key. Never use `index` for reorderable/filterable/dynamic lists.

56. **`next/font` for Font Loading**:
Never use Google Fonts CDN (`@import`). Always use `next/font/google`.

57. **Strict `tsconfig.json` Enforcement**:
Run with `strict: true`. No `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-nocheck`. (Mechanically enforced via pre-commit, see Rule 61).

58. **No Direct Browser Storage Access in Components**:
Never call `window.localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, or `document.cookie` directly inside React components.

Use approved isolated hooks/services:
- `useLocalStorage` for non-sensitive persisted UI preferences.
- Secure HTTP-only cookies for authentication/session tokens.
- Never store access tokens, refresh tokens, passwords, payment data, or permission grants in localStorage.

All storage keys must:
- Be defined in a centralized constants file.
- Be namespaced by application and module.
- Have a documented schema/version where persisted object data is used.

Example:
`APP_MODULE_FILTERS_V1`
`APP_DASHBOARD_LAYOUT_V1`

59. **Standardized `ApiResponse<T>` Generic (The API Contract)**:
Every API call must be typed using a global `ApiResponse<T>` generic interface that perfectly matches the backend response envelope (Backend Rule 28). Both Success and Error responses must share this exact canonical shape:

```typescript
export interface ApiResponse<T> {
  success: boolean;                         // true on 2xx, false on all errors
  message: string;                          // human-readable, always present
  data: T | null;                           // response payload OR null on error
  meta?: PaginationMeta;                    // present only on paginated list responses
  error?: string;                           // error name / category (e.g. "NOT_FOUND")
  errorCode?: string;                       // machine-readable DOMAIN.ENTITY.REASON code
  statusCode?: number;                      // HTTP status code, present on error responses
  validationErrors?: ValidationErrorItem[]; // present ONLY on 400 validation failures
}

export interface ValidationErrorItem {
  field: string;    // exact DTO property name, dot-notation for nested fields
  message: string;  // human-readable error from class-validator
}

export interface PaginationMeta {
  total: number;       // total records matching the query
  page: number;        // current page (1-based)
  limit: number;       // records per page
  totalPages: number;  // Math.ceil(total / limit)
  hasNextPage: boolean;
  hasPrevPage: boolean;
}
```

This interface is the single source of truth for all API response parsing across the application. Never define a partial or alternative shape.

60. **No Direct `router.push('/login')` in Components**:
Handle unauthenticated redirects centrally in `middleware.ts` or an API interceptor.

61. **Enforced Tooling Gates (Mechanical Blocking)**:
Rules against arbitrary Tailwind (Rule 36), `any` types (Rule 27), `console.log` (Rule 44), magic strings (Rule 35), and TS ignores (Rule 57) are not just "trust-based suggestions". 
You MUST physically block these using the following exact mechanical ESLint/tooling mappings:

- `Rule 27 (any type)` -> `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
- `Rule 36 (arbitrary Tailwind)` -> `tailwindcss/no-arbitrary-value`
- `Rule 44 (console.log)` -> `no-console`
- `Rule 57 (TS ignore)` -> `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment`
- `Rule 63 (cross-module imports)` -> enforcement MUST distinguish:
  ```text
  GLOBAL APPLICATION INFRASTRUCTURE
  ROLE CONTAINER
  FEATURE MODULE
  ```
  and MUST block:
  ```text
  FEATURE → SIBLING FEATURE
  FEATURE → ROLE-LEVEL BUSINESS FOLDER
  FEATURE → OTHER ROLE BUSINESS MODULE
  ```
  unless the import is explicitly classified as approved application infrastructure.

  Mechanical tooling SHOULD use:
  * `eslint-plugin-boundaries`
  * `no-restricted-imports`
  * TypeScript path aliases where useful
  * repository-level architecture validation where necessary

  The architectural rule is:
  ```text
  Feature → Global Infrastructure       ALLOWED
  Feature → Own Feature                 ALLOWED
  Feature → Child Feature               ALLOWED when ownership remains inside the module
  Feature → Sibling Business Feature    FORBIDDEN
  Feature → Role Business Bucket        FORBIDDEN
  Feature → Other Role Feature          FORBIDDEN
  ```

### FINAL FEATURE PORTABILITY ACCEPTANCE TEST

A feature MUST NOT be marked AI-portable merely because its files happen to be stored under one directory.

The following test MUST be satisfied:

```text
STEP 1
Give an AI only:

@/role/feature/

STEP 2
The AI reads the feature's feature map.

STEP 3
The AI identifies:
- business purpose
- routes
- user flows
- UI ownership
- state ownership
- API contracts
- schemas
- mocks
- tests
- permissions
- error/loading/empty behavior
- approved external dependencies

STEP 4
The AI can identify which files it must modify for a normal feature bug.

STEP 5
The AI does not require unrelated business modules.

STEP 6
The AI's normal repair changes only the owning feature.
```

If these conditions are not satisfied, the feature is NOT considered fully modular or AI-portable.

---

### FINAL ARCHITECTURAL PRINCIPLE

The project prioritizes:

```text
AI CONTEXT ISOLATION
>
BUSINESS CODE REUSE
```

and:

```text
BOUNDED CHANGE BLAST RADIUS
>
MINIMUM FILE DUPLICATION
```

The purpose of this architecture is to ensure that a feature can be:

```text
understood independently
+
tested independently
+
repaired independently
+
mocked independently
+
copied independently
+
evolved independently
```

without requiring unrelated business modules.
- `Rule 35 (magic values)` -> custom `no-restricted-syntax` / custom rule

You MUST implement a **pre-commit hook** (`husky` + `lint-staged`) that runs `tsc --noEmit` and linters before any commit. These rules must be physically blocked by tooling to ensure extreme safety in an AI-driven codebase. Detailed test practices should reside in Rule 15A.

### Required CI Quality Gates

Every pull request must run:

1. Type Check
   - `tsc --noEmit`

2. Lint and Formatting
   - ESLint
   - Tailwind class validation
   - Prettier formatting check

3. Tests
   - Unit and component tests
   - Coverage threshold validation

4. Build
   - Production build must succeed

5. Security
   - Dependency vulnerability scan
   - Secret detection scan

6. E2E Tests
   - Mandatory for authentication, billing, permissions, destructive actions, and critical CRUD flows.

No PR may merge if a required gate fails.

62. **Dependency-Addition Guardrail**:
AI agents frequently install redundant packages. **An AI cannot add a new dependency without checking `package.json` first.** Before adding a new library, you must explicitly flag why an existing approved library (e.g., React Hook Form, Zod, date-fns, Zustand, socket.io-client, lucide-react, react-apexcharts (canonical chart library — see global_design_system.md §10; Recharts and Chart.js are forbidden)) does not suffice for the task.

63. **Zero Cross-Module Imports & Controlled Infrastructure Dependencies**:
- **Zero Cross-Module Business Imports:** Module A (e.g., `billing`) is explicitly FORBIDDEN from importing business logic from Module B (e.g., `attendance`) — no business components, hooks, stores, schemas, types, constants, API services, or business utilities. This MUST be mechanically enforced using ESLint (`no-restricted-imports` or `eslint-plugin-boundaries`).
- **Controlled Infrastructure Dependencies:** A feature/module MAY depend on approved application infrastructure that is intentionally global and contains no feature-specific business logic, including:
  - `src/components/ui/` — dumb reusable UI primitives
  - `src/lib/api.ts` — canonical network/API infrastructure
  - `src/lib/logger.ts` — centralized logging infrastructure
  - `src/lib/formatters.ts` — canonical formatting infrastructure (`formatCurrencyFromMinorUnits`, `formatNumber`, `displayValue`, `maskSensitiveData`)
  - authentication/session infrastructure
  - approved configuration and observability infrastructure
- `src/lib/` MUST NOT become a generic business-logic dumping ground. Feature-specific business logic MUST remain inside the owning feature/module.
- If a business utility is required by multiple business modules, duplicate it inside those modules rather than moving it into a global shared business utility.

**Portable Folder Definition:**
A feature is considered portable when it has no dependency on another feature's business implementation. Approved global infrastructure dependencies are allowed because they are architectural contracts of the application, not feature business dependencies.

64. **Strict Mobile-First Enforcement (Tailwind is not magic)**:
Tailwind does not automatically make things responsive. Every component must be built **mobile-first**: base Tailwind classes must target mobile (`<768px`), then overridden with `md:` (tablet) and `lg:/xl:` (desktop) prefixes as needed.
- No component is considered complete unless explicitly checked at all three breakpoints (375px, 768px, 1280px+). 
- Specific Mobile Patterns: KPI card rows must switch to horizontal scrolling or a 2-column grid on mobile. Charts must have reduced height and simplified/collapsed legends on mobile.
- **Button Containers & Filters**: Any flex container holding multiple buttons or filter inputs (like date ranges) MUST use `flex-col sm:flex-row` or `flex-wrap` so they stack natively on mobile rather than bleeding off the edge of the card.
- **Persistent Mobile Table Actions**: Table action buttons (Edit, Delete, etc.) MUST NOT use `opacity-0` globally to hide behind hover states, as mobile devices have no mouse hover. You must use `opacity-100 lg:opacity-0 lg:group-hover:opacity-100` so actions are permanently visible on touch devices.
- **Dropdown Auto-Close**: Any custom filter dropdown menu MUST automatically close (`setShowFilter(false)`) immediately after the user makes a selection.

65. **Hardened Numeric Inputs (Prevent Negative/Invalid Inputs)**:
Never use a naked `<input type="number">` for quantities, prices, or ages without explicit validation. Enforce numeric constraints primarily through form/schema validation and `min`/`max`/`step`. Use key filtering only when the business rule explicitly forbids characters and the filtering does not block valid required input.

66. **Optimistic UI Reconciliation with Authoritative Server Response (No Undefined Rows)**:
When an optimistic update is used, the TanStack Query cache MUST be reconciled with the authoritative backend response after success. Do not permanently retain the optimistic form payload as server data. Failing to replace the optimistic row in the Query cache with `res.data` upon success will result in "undefined" columns and broken subsequent edit/delete actions.

67. **Explicit API Parameter Propagation (Filters & Pagination)**:
Never assume UI state magically filters backend data. Custom hooks (`use[Module]Logic`) MUST explicitly extract all relevant values (e.g., `debouncedSearch`, `page`, `limit`, `statusFilter`) from state or URL query parameters, construct a `params` object, and pass it directly to the API wrapper. If you forget to pass `params` to the API call, the UI search box will appear broken to the user.

68. **Table Header & Column Alignment Integrity**:
You MUST ensure that the length of the headers array (e.g., `TABLE_HEADERS`) EXACTLY matches the number of rendered `<td>` columns in the `<tbody>` row. This includes custom `<td>`s for avatars, checkboxes, or badges. Any empty state `colSpan` values (e.g., `colSpan={9}`) MUST also statically or dynamically match this exact column count. Mismatched columns will completely break the table alignment across all rows.

69. **Social Brand Color Tokens (No Undefined Variables)**:
Never use undefined CSS variables (e.g., `var(--members-whatsapp)`) for standard social action buttons. Map social brand colors to design tokens in `tailwind.config.ts` (e.g., `bg-social-whatsapp`). Relying on undefined variables will cause the buttons to become transparent with white text, making them completely invisible in Light Mode.

70. **Interactive KPI Cards as Filters**:
KPI cards MUST function as filters when the KPI represents a meaningful filterable subset of the adjacent table. Informational KPIs MAY remain non-interactive. When functioning as interactive filters, clicking a KPI card should filter the table below to show only the relevant rows. Include a visual indicator (e.g., a primary colored border or ring) to show which KPI filter is currently active, and always ensure there is a clear way to reset the filter (such as a "Total" card or toggling off).

71. **Double Verification for Critical Actions (Destructive/Financial)**:
Whenever presenting an action button that triggers a destructive or critical financial mutation (e.g., deleting a record, suspending a user, or marking an invoice/payroll as paid), you MUST implement a double verification confirmation dialog. Never execute these actions instantly on a single click. Utilize a global `useConfirm` hook or a similar custom modal to explicitly ask the user (e.g., "Are you sure you want to mark this as paid?").

72. **Strict API Client Function Naming Convention (The Verb Contract)**:
Every function defined inside a module's `[moduleName]_api.ts` file MUST follow a strict, predictable verb-based naming convention. AI agents must never invent arbitrary function names like `loadMembers()`, `getData()`, or `handleFetch()`. The standard is:
- `fetch[Entities](params)` — For fetching a list (e.g., `fetchMembers(params)`)
- `fetch[Entity]ById(id)` — For fetching a single entity (e.g., `fetchMemberById(id)`)
- `create[Entity](dto)` — For POST creation (e.g., `createMember(dto)`)
- `update[Entity](id, dto)` — For PATCH/PUT updates (e.g., `updateMember(id, dto)`)
- `delete[Entity](id)` — For DELETE (e.g., `deleteMember(id)`)
- `export[Entity]Report(params)` — For report/export generation
- For non-CRUD domain actions, use the exact operation name from the **external API contract** (e.g., `renew[Entity]`, `suspend[Entity]`, `restore[Entity]`, `activate[Entity]`, `assign[Entity]`). Do NOT couple frontend API client names to backend internal service method names. If the backend renames an internal service class or method, the frontend API contract must not break.

73. **`import type` Mandate for Type-Only Imports**:
Whenever importing a TypeScript type, interface, or enum that is used purely for type-checking (not as a runtime value), you MUST use the `import type` syntax. Never use a regular `import` for type-only constructs.
- ❌ **BAD:** `import { MemberTableProps } from '@/app/admin/members/members_types/member.types'`
- ✅ **GOOD:** `import type { MemberTableProps } from '@/app/admin/members/members_types/member.types'`
- **Why:** `import type` statements are completely erased at compile time, reducing bundle size, preventing accidental runtime usage of type definitions, and eliminating a major category of circular dependency errors. TypeScript's `verbatimModuleSyntax` compiler option can mechanically enforce this. This mirrors Backend Rule 88's `import type` mandate for the backend.

74. **Security Scanning in Frontend CI/CD Tooling Gates (Extending Rule 61)**:
Rule 61 mandates ESLint, `tsc --noEmit`, and pre-commit hooks. This rule adds mandatory **security gates** to the frontend CI/CD pipeline, mirroring Backend Rules 90 & 91:
- **Gate 1 — SCA (Dependency Vulnerability Scan):** Run `npm audit --audit-level=high` or an approved SCA tool on every PR. Any `Critical` or `High` severity CVE in a frontend dependency MUST block the merge. Frontend packages (including `react`, `axios`, `next`) have real CVEs that AI agents will never proactively check for.
- **Gate 2 — Secrets Detection:** Run `gitleaks detect` on every PR diff. Frontend code frequently contains accidentally committed API keys, Stripe public keys, or environment variables. This gate is non-negotiable.
- **Gate 3 — Pre-Commit Secret Scan:** Add `gitleaks detect --no-git` (staged files only) to the existing `husky + lint-staged` pre-commit hook so secrets are caught locally before pushing.
- **Why:** An AI agent configuring a new third-party SDK (e.g., a payment widget) may accidentally commit a test API key directly into a component file. Automated scanning catches this before it enters source control history.

75. **Module-Owned MSW / Mock Architecture**:

When a backend endpoint does not yet exist, the frontend MUST use MSW to intercept the real frontend API request and return a realistic mock response.

It is strictly forbidden to hardcode fake business data directly inside:

- Components
- Hooks
- Pages
- UI constants
- Stores
- Contexts

Every module MUST own its own feature-specific mock fixtures and MSW handlers.

Example:

src/app/
└── members/
    ├── members_components/
    ├── members_hooks/
    ├── members_api/
    ├── members_types/
    ├── members_schemas/
    ├── members_store/
    ├── members_tests/
    ├── members_mocks/
    │   ├── handlers/
    │   │   └── ManagerMembersMockHandlers.ts
    │   └── fixtures/
    │       └── ManagerMembersMockFixtures.ts
    ├── members_features.md
    ├── members_forbidden.md
    └── members_theme_contract.md

The exact folder/file names may follow the module naming rules, but ownership is mandatory:

Feature-specific mock fixtures belong to the feature.
Feature-specific MSW handlers belong to the feature.
Feature-specific mock response builders belong to the feature.

Only the MSW application bootstrap/registration mechanism may remain outside the module.

### 75A. Global MSW Bootstrap Exception

A small global MSW bootstrap/registration mechanism MAY exist outside feature modules.

Its responsibilities are limited to:

- Starting MSW
- Registering module-owned handlers
- Enabling MSW in development/test environments
- Disabling MSW in production
- Framework-level MSW configuration

The global bootstrap MUST NOT contain:

- Feature mock fixtures
- Feature business data
- Feature response builders
- Feature-specific request logic
- Feature-specific validation
- Feature-specific business rules
- Feature-specific transformations

The global MSW bootstrap is infrastructure only.

Example:

src/infrastructure/msw/browser.ts

This file may import/register:

- members module handlers
- superadmin module handlers
- trainer module handlers

But it must NOT contain their mock data or handler implementations.

### 75B. No Feature-Specific Mock Outside the Owning Module

Feature-specific mock artifacts MUST NOT be placed in:

- src/mocks/
- src/shared/
- src/common/
- src/utils/
- other modules
- other role folders

unless the file is explicitly classified as genuine global infrastructure.

This includes:

- mock fixtures
- mock datasets
- mock response builders
- mock request helpers containing business behavior
- module-specific MSW handlers
- module-specific mock constants

If a mock represents server/API data for one module, it belongs inside that module.

Do not create a generic global mock-data repository to avoid duplication.

For AI-driven development, localized duplication is preferred over cross-module business coupling.

### 75C. Global Infrastructure vs Module-Owned Logic

A file may remain outside a module only when it is genuine application/framework infrastructure.

The fact that several modules use a file does NOT automatically make it global infrastructure.

A file qualifies as global infrastructure only when:

1. It provides framework/application plumbing.
2. It contains no module-specific business behavior.
3. Duplicating it would cause conflicting global configuration or behavior.
4. Its responsibility is stable and explicitly documented.

Examples of valid global infrastructure:

- Global API transport client
- Authentication/token interceptor
- Global error-monitoring adapter
- Application bootstrap
- Global MSW bootstrap
- Design-system primitives
- Global configuration

Examples that MUST remain module-owned:

- Superadmin gym fixtures
- Member mock records
- Invoice mock responses
- Billing-specific fake data
- Module-specific handlers
- Module-specific validation
- Module-specific business constants
- Module-specific business formatters

75D. **Complete MSW UI Contract & Fixture Coverage — No Missing UI Data**:
MSW is not merely a network mock. During frontend-first development, each MSW handler MUST provide a complete, realistic response that satisfies **every data requirement of the UI that consumes that endpoint**.

An MSW handler MUST NOT return a minimal response containing only a few convenient fields while leaving other rendered UI fields empty, undefined, or permanently unavailable.

Before creating or modifying an MSW handler, the AI agent MUST inspect the complete consuming UI and identify the exact data required by:
- Every table column
- Every table row
- Every KPI / statistic card
- Every chart and chart series
- Every filter
- Every searchable field
- Every sorting field
- Every pagination control
- Every dropdown/select option
- Every detail view
- Every modal/drawer
- Every badge/status indicator
- Every timeline/history entry
- Every summary section
- Every relationship/reference displayed by the UI

### UI-to-API Data Contract Requirement

For every data-consuming feature, the following chain MUST be explicitly aligned:

```text
UI Requirement
      ↓
Module API Contract
      ↓
Module Type
      ↓
Module Zod Schema
      ↓
Module-Owned MSW Fixture
      ↓
Module-Owned MSW Handler
      ↓
TanStack Query
      ↓
Module UI Rendering
```

The mock fixture and handler must belong to the same module as the consuming feature. They must not be retrieved from another business module merely because that module owns similar data.

The AI MUST NOT invent a disconnected mock response merely to satisfy TypeScript.
The MSW response MUST contain all fields that the UI actually consumes.

### Required Data Coverage Matrix

Every feature that depends on MSW MUST document or be able to derive the following mapping (use the `## UI Data Requirements` section of its `_features.md` — see Rule 13):

| UI Element | Required Field(s) | API Endpoint | Response Path | Nullable? | Mocked? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Table: Gym Name | `name` | `GET /.../gyms` | `data.items[].name` | No | Yes |
| Table: Owner | `ownerName` | `GET /.../gyms` | `data.items[].ownerName` | Yes | Yes |
| KPI: Active Gyms | `activeCount` | `GET /.../gyms/stats` | `data.activeCount` | No | Yes |
| Filter: Plan | `planId`, `planName` | `GET /.../gyms` | `data.items[]` | No | Yes |

The actual project feature MUST use its real field names, endpoint names, and response paths. The example above is illustrative only.

### Fixture Completeness Rules

MSW fixtures MUST contain enough records and value variation to exercise the actual UI. For list/table features, mock data MUST include realistic variation for at least:
- Multiple records
- Different statuses
- Different plans/categories where applicable
- Different dates
- Different numeric values
- Nullable/optional fields
- Long text values where truncation is expected
- Searchable values
- Filterable values
- Sortable values
- Enough records to exercise pagination
- At least one realistic empty-result scenario
- At least one realistic error scenario through a separate MSW handler/state

These fixtures are part of the owning module's test/development boundary and MUST remain physically inside that module.

Fixture completeness must never be achieved by adding hardcoded fallback data to UI components.

The exact number of records is determined by the feature's pagination and UI requirements. Do not artificially limit a paginated feature to one or two records when the UI requires multiple pages to be testable.

### Table Completeness Rule

For every rendered table:
1. Every visible header MUST correspond to a real response field.
2. Every row cell MUST receive its value from the API response or an explicitly documented derived value.
3. No table cell may depend on an undocumented mock-only field.
4. No required cell may silently render `undefined` because the MSW fixture omitted the field.
5. Nullable fields MUST use the canonical nullable display fallback (Rule 78 `displayValue()`).
6. Header count, cell count, and `colSpan` MUST remain consistent (Rule 68).

### KPI and Chart Completeness Rule

For every KPI or chart:
- Every displayed metric MUST have a defined response source.
- Every chart series MUST have mocked values.
- Every chart axis used by the UI MUST have corresponding mock data.
- Empty datasets MUST be explicitly handled.
- Loading, success, empty, and error states MUST all be testable with MSW.

A chart MUST NOT render because static values were embedded directly inside the component.

### Filter / Search / Pagination Rule

If the UI contains search, filter, sort, or pagination, the MSW handler MUST support the corresponding request parameters and return data that makes those interactions visibly testable.

```text
search=active
→ handler receives search parameter
→ handler filters fixture dataset
→ response contains matching records
→ UI visibly changes
```

The AI MUST NOT implement a visually interactive filter that always returns the same mocked dataset.

### Dropdown / Relationship Rule

For dropdowns and relational fields:
- If the options are backend-driven, mock them through an API endpoint/MSW handler.
- If they are truly static UI constants, keep them in the feature-specific constants architecture defined by Rule 3B. Do not duplicate backend-driven options inside component constants.
- When one entity references another entity, the mock response MUST provide the relationship data required by the UI.

```text
Gym
 ├── planId
 ├── planName
 ├── ownerId
 └── ownerName
```

If the UI displays `planName` and `ownerName`, the MSW response must provide those values through the documented API contract or through an explicitly documented relationship mapping.

### No "Minimal Mock" Rule

This pattern is **forbidden**:
```text
UI requires: name, owner, plan, memberCount, revenue, status
MSW returns: id, name, status
```
This creates a false implementation where the page appears structurally complete but cannot render the actual product data correctly. The AI MUST fix the contract/fixture instead of adding hardcoded fallback values to the component.

### No Component-Level Mock Fallback

This pattern is **forbidden**:
```ts
// ❌ FORBIDDEN
const ownerName = apiData.ownerName ?? "Demo Owner";
const revenue = apiData.revenue ?? 125000;
```
when those values are required fields of the API contract. Do not use hardcoded fallback business data to hide an incomplete MSW response.

Correct approach:
```text
UI requires field
→ update API contract
→ update TypeScript type
→ update Zod schema
→ update MSW fixture
→ render from response
```

### Fixture Source-of-Truth Rule

MSW fixtures are mock implementations of the API contract. They are NOT an alternative business-data architecture.

The following separation MUST be preserved:
```text
Static UI Configuration  → feature constants (Rule 3B)
Server/API Data          → API contract + Zod → MSW fixtures → real backend
UI State                 → local state / Zustand
Server State             → TanStack Query
```

### Backend Transition Rule

When the real backend endpoint becomes available:
- The UI MUST continue consuming the same API contract.
- The feature API client MUST remain the same unless the backend contract legitimately changes.
- Components MUST NOT require a rewrite merely because mocked responses are replaced by real responses.
- Any contract change MUST update the corresponding TypeScript types, Zod schemas, MSW handlers, `_features.md` documentation, and tests in the same change.

Backend integration does NOT require moving module-owned mocks or handlers into a global mock folder.

The ownership remains:

Development/Test:
Module → Module API Client → Module-Owned MSW Handler → Module-Owned Fixture

Production:
Module → Module API Client → Real Backend

MSW must be disabled in the production path.

Module-owned handlers and fixtures remain available for development, tests, error simulation, empty-state simulation, pagination/filter/sort scenarios, and other deterministic test scenarios.

### AI Verification Requirement

Before declaring a frontend feature complete, the AI MUST verify:
1. Every displayed data field has a documented source (in `## UI Data Requirements` of `_features.md`).
2. Every source exists in the response type/schema.
3. Every required response field is returned by the MSW handler.
4. Every MSW field is consumed correctly by the UI where applicable.
5. Tables display populated values in all intended columns.
6. KPIs display non-placeholder values.
7. Charts receive complete series data.
8. Filters/search/sorting/pagination produce different mocked results where applicable.
9. Empty states can actually be triggered.
10. Error states can actually be triggered.
11. No component/hook contains hidden hardcoded business fallback data.
12. The feature works using the same API access path that will be used with the real backend.

A feature MUST NOT be marked complete merely because TypeScript compiles or the page visually renders.

### Completion Standard

```text
"Backend does not exist yet"
        DOES NOT MEAN
"Return a tiny fake response"

It means:

"Backend does not exist yet,
so MSW temporarily behaves like the backend
and must faithfully provide the complete API data contract
required by the finished UI."
```

76. **`CODEOWNERS` Human Review Gate for Security-Critical Frontend Code**:
Just as Backend Rule 93 mandates human review for `auth/`, `billing/`, and `permissions/` backend modules, the frontend MUST implement a `CODEOWNERS` file requiring mandatory human reviewer approval on PRs that touch security-critical frontend paths. AI agents cannot self-certify security-critical UI changes.
- **Mandatory Human Review Required For:**
  1. **Auth UI** — Any changes to `src/app/auth/` (login form, logout, refresh logic).
  2. **API Interceptor & Token Logic** — Any changes to the centralized `api.ts` wrapper, the token refresh interceptor, or `middleware.ts`.
  3. **Permission Hooks** — Any changes to `usePermissions()` or any hook that conditionally hides/shows restricted UI elements.
  4. **Payment UI** — Any component that triggers a payment, displays financial data, or handles billing actions.
- **PR Description Mandate:** Any PR touching these paths MUST include a `## Security Impact Analysis` section explaining what changed and why it's safe.
- **Why:** A subtle bug in the frontend's token refresh logic or a missing `usePermissions()` check can expose restricted data to unauthorized users — purely a client-side authorization bypass. Automated ESLint and TypeScript checks cannot catch semantic security flaws. A human review is the final gate.

77. **CI/CD Merge Policy and Branch Protection**:
Every pull request must pass the following pipeline before merge:

1. **Quality**
   - ESLint
   - Prettier check
   - Tailwind linting
   - TypeScript type check

2. **Security**
   - Dependency vulnerability scan
   - Secret scan
   - License/compliance scan if required by the organization

3. **Tests**
   - Vitest unit/component tests
   - Coverage thresholds
   - Playwright E2E tests for applicable critical flows

4. **Build**
   - Production Next.js build
   - Bundle analysis for major changes

5. **Review**
   - Mandatory CODEOWNERS approval for auth, permissions, billing, payment, and security-sensitive paths.
   - AI-generated PR descriptions must list files changed, tests run, risk areas, and rollback impact.

Branch protection requirements:
- No direct push to `main`.
- No merge with failing checks.
- No bypass for CODEOWNERS on security-sensitive files.
- Require at least one human approval for all AI-generated changes.

78. **The "En-Dash" Rule for Empty Data (Visual Integrity)**:
Never render completely blank table cells or profile field values when an API returns `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string for optional fields. Always use a meaningful fallback so the user explicitly knows the value is intentionally absent — not a rendering failure or a loading bug.
- **Standard fallback:** Use an en-dash (`—`) for table cells and detail views: `{displayValue(data.optionalField)}`
- **Numeric fields:** Use `0` or `—` depending on whether zero is a valid meaningful value (e.g., `totalSessions` should show `0`, but `assignedTrainer` should show `—`).
- **Why:** A blank cell is visually indistinguishable from a broken render or a missing API field. An en-dash is an explicit, intentional signal to the user that the data does not exist. This is especially critical in financial tables, member profiles, and audit logs where a blank value could be misread as a data integrity issue.
- ❌ **BAD:** `<td>{member.trainerName}</td>` — renders nothing if `null`
- ✅ **GOOD:** `<td>{displayValue(member.trainerName)}</td>` — renders `—` explicitly
- **Centralize the fallback:** Define a shared utility `displayValue` in `src/lib/formatters.ts`. `displayValue()` accepts all primitive display values required by the UI, including string, number, boolean, null, and undefined, while preserving meaningful zero/false values.

79. **Unsaved Changes Guard (Data Loss Prevention)**:
Any complex form or multi-step wizard MUST implement a "Dirty State Guard" to prevent accidental data loss. Rule 79 supersedes Rule 46 for scope; Rule 46 defines only the browser `beforeunload` mechanism.
- **This rule additionally mandates** interception of in-app Next.js router navigation. `beforeunload` does NOT fire on client-side route changes in the Next.js App Router. You MUST implement a `useUnsavedChangesGuard(isDirty: boolean)` custom hook that:
  1. Listens to `beforeunload` for browser-level exits.
  2. Uses a navigation interception pattern (e.g., a custom `useBlocker`-style hook or a prompt triggered before `router.push`) to catch in-app navigation when `formState.isDirty === true`.
  3. Displays a confirmation dialog: *"You have unsaved changes. Are you sure you want to leave? Your changes will be lost."*
  4. Only proceeds with navigation if the user explicitly confirms.
- **Scope:** Apply to all forms with 3+ fields, all multi-step wizards, and any modal where the user has typed or selected values.
- **Reset condition:** The guard must be deactivated immediately after a successful form submission or an explicit "Discard Changes" action.
- ❌ **BAD:** User fills a 3-step Add Member wizard, accidentally clicks a sidebar link, and loses all entered data with no warning.
- ✅ **GOOD:** `useUnsavedChangesGuard(formState.isDirty)` intercepts the navigation and shows a confirm dialog before the route changes.

80. **Currency & Number Formatting Standardization**:
Never manually concatenate currency symbols, format numbers with raw `.toFixed()`, or build locale strings directly inside JSX or component logic. All financial values and large numeric metrics MUST be piped through a centralized formatting utility.
- **Minor-unit contract:** API monetary values are stored as minor units (paise, cents). Use `formatCurrencyFromMinorUnits(value, currencyCode)` which divides by 100 before formatting. Never pass a raw API minor-unit value to a display formatter that expects major units — this causes a 100× display error.
- **Required utilities:** Define `formatCurrencyFromMinorUnits(amountMinor: number, currencyCode?: string): string` and `formatNumber(value: number): string` in `src/lib/formatters.ts`. This is the single source of truth for all numeric display formatting across the entire application.
- **Locale consistency:** The utility must use the `Intl.NumberFormat` API to ensure consistent comma separators, decimal places, and currency symbol placement based on the app's configured locale — never hardcoded.
- **Decimal precision:** Financial values MUST use the centralized currency formatter. Default precision is 2 decimals unless the product/UI contract explicitly specifies another precision. Metric counts (e.g., total members) must display with comma separators but no decimals.
- **This rule is the numeric parallel to Rule 24** (which standardizes date/time formatting via `date-fns`/`dayjs`). Just as Rule 24 forbids raw `new Date()` in JSX, this rule forbids raw number concatenation.
- ❌ **BAD:** `<td>₹{payment.amount.toFixed(2)}</td>` — `payment.amount` is in paise; this displays 100× too large.
- ✅ **GOOD:** `<td>{formatCurrencyFromMinorUnits(payment.amount, 'INR')}</td>`
- **ESLint enforcement:** Add a custom ESLint rule or `no-restricted-syntax` pattern to flag direct `.toFixed()` calls and currency symbol string concatenation in `.tsx` files.

81. **Button Loading Width Stability (No Layout Shifts)**:
Buttons that enter a loading state MUST maintain their exact original width. When a button's text label is replaced by a `Loader2` spinner (as mandated by Rule 26), the button must not shrink or collapse, as this causes a jarring layout shift that breaks the visual rhythm of forms and toolbars.
- **Required pattern:** Apply a semantic `min-w-*` class (e.g., `min-w-32`) dynamically on the button, OR replace only the leading icon with the spinner while keeping the text label visible (e.g., "Saving..."), OR use a fixed-width wrapper.
- **Recommended approach:** Keep the button text visible alongside the spinner during loading (e.g., `<Loader2 className="animate-spin" /> Saving...`) rather than replacing the text entirely. This also improves accessibility by maintaining a readable label for screen readers.
- **Forbidden pattern:** Never let a button collapse to icon-only width during loading if it was originally a full text button. The width change is visually disruptive, especially in form footers where multiple buttons are aligned.
- ❌ **BAD:** Button reads "Save Changes" (120px wide) → loading state shows only `<Loader2>` (32px wide) → layout shifts.
- ✅ **GOOD:** Button reads "Save Changes" → loading state shows `<Loader2 /> Saving...` at the same width, or `min-w` is set to lock the width.
- **Applies to:** All submit buttons, confirmation buttons in modals, and any async action trigger button across the entire application.

82. **Toast Deduplication (No Stacking Identical Notifications)**:
Global toast notifications MUST be deduplicated. If a specific toast (identified by its message string or a semantic error code) is already visible on screen, subsequent identical triggers must either silently refresh the toast's auto-dismiss timer or be completely ignored — never stack multiple identical toasts.
- **Why this matters:** In modules with heavy API interaction (e.g., a billing page where a user rapidly clicks "Retry" on a failing request), the same error toast can stack 5–10 times, flooding the screen and degrading the user experience significantly.
- **Implementation:** Use the toast library's built-in deduplication ID feature. Pass a stable `toastId` derived from the error code or message hash when calling `toast.error(message, { id: errorCode })`. Most toast libraries (e.g., `react-hot-toast`, `sonner`) support this natively.
- **Global Auth/Transport Errors:** Global errors may use a global toast deduplication pattern in the centralized interceptor.
- **Module Business Errors:** Module-specific business errors MUST NOT be toasted globally by the interceptor. The module decides presentation.
- **Canonical pattern (For any emitted toast):**
  ```ts
  // Whenever a toast is actually emitted, pass a stable ID
  toast.error(res.message, { id: res.error ?? `module-action-entityId-${res.message}` });
  ```
- `entityId` must be the actual stable entity/resource identifier when one exists; never use a literal placeholder or message-only ID when distinct entities can legitimately emit the same message.
- **Success toasts:** Apply the same deduplication for success toasts on rapid repeated actions (e.g., toggling a status on/off quickly).
- **Never deduplicate:** Do NOT deduplicate toasts for genuinely distinct events (e.g., two different members being deleted in sequence). Deduplication applies only to identical messages triggered by the same repeated action.
- **ESLint note:** All raw `toast()` calls outside of `src/lib/api.ts` or the approved toast utility wrapper should be flagged for review to ensure the `id` field is always passed.



83. **Idempotency-Key for Financial and Irreversible Mutations (Web Equivalent of Mobile Rule 53)**:
Any mutation that is financial, irreversible, or non-duplicable (payment recording, invoice creation, payroll processing, membership renewal) MUST attach an `Idempotency-Key` header to the HTTP request.
- **Key generation:** Generate a UUID exactly once per user intent — at the moment the user confirms the action (e.g., inside the `useConfirm()` handler, not at the `onClick` of the trigger button).
- **Retry behavior:** If the request times out or returns a 5xx response and the user or the app retries, it MUST send the **exact same** `Idempotency-Key`. Never generate a fresh key for a retry of the same intent.
- **Key scope:** One key per user-initiated action. If the user cancels and re-opens the confirmation dialog, a new key is generated.
- **Implementation:** Add the key in `apiFetch` via an optional `idempotencyKey` parameter, or accept it as a per-request header override in the module's API client.
- ❌ **BAD:** Generating `crypto.randomUUID()` on every retry attempt — the backend may process the request twice, creating duplicate payments.
- ✅ **GOOD:** Generate the key in the confirm handler, store it in a `useRef`, and reuse it on all retries until the mutation succeeds or is explicitly abandoned.

Cross-reference: Backend Rule 31 (idempotency contract), Mobile Rule 53 (same requirement on mobile).

84. **Strict Case Sensitivity for File Names and Imports (Linux/CI Compatibility)**:
All imports and file paths MUST exactly match the casing of the actual file on disk. While development often happens on Windows/macOS (which have case-insensitive file systems), production deployments and CI pipelines typically run on Linux (which has a strict case-sensitive file system).
- **Rule:** A mismatch between import case (e.g., `trainer_url_config`) and file case (e.g., `Trainer_url_config.ts`) will cause the build to fail in CI/CD.
- **Enforcement:** Always double-check that the casing of module prefixes and filenames in imports matches exactly. If you rename a file, ensure the git index catches the case change (e.g., using `git mv`).
- ❌ **BAD:** File is `UserComponent.tsx`, imported as `import UserComponent from './userComponent'`.
- ✅ **GOOD:** File is `UserComponent.tsx`, imported as `import UserComponent from './UserComponent'`.

---
Think step-by-step. Create a detailed implementation plan first so I can review it, and then execute it perfectly without breaking existing data flows!

## Rule 14 — Idempotency for API Mutations

All mutating API endpoints (POST, PATCH, PUT, DELETE) on the backend strictly enforce idempotency (`@RequireIdempotencyKey()`). Therefore, EVERY frontend API client function that performs a mutation MUST accept an optional `idempotencyKey?: string` parameter and inject it into the HTTP headers as `{'Idempotency-Key': idempotencyKey}`. Failure to do so will result in an immediate HTTP 400 rejection from the backend.

Example:
```typescript
export const updateProfile = async (id: string, body: any, idempotencyKey?: string) => apiFetch('/profile', {
  method: 'PATCH',
  body: JSON.stringify(body),
  headers: idempotencyKey ? { 'Idempotency-Key': idempotencyKey } : undefined,
});
```

## Rule 15 — WebSockets & Real-Time Communication
* **The Rule:** WebSockets must never be instantiated directly via `new WebSocket()` or `io()` inside UI components. 
* **Implementation:** Always use a centralized `WebSocketContext` or `SocketProvider` to manage connection lifecycles (connect, disconnect, reconnect). Feature modules must consume WebSockets via dedicated custom hooks (e.g., `useSocketEvent('NOTIFICATION_RECEIVED', callback)`). This guarantees that event listeners are correctly cleaned up on component unmount and avoids memory leaks.

## Rule 16 — Role-Based Field Masking & Optional Types
* **The Rule:** The backend strictly masks sensitive data fields (like revenue) based on the user's role before transmitting the response. 
* **Implementation:** Frontend TypeScript interfaces and Zod schemas MUST mark these potentially masked fields as optional (`?`). UI components consuming this data must implement graceful fallback behavior (e.g., hiding a specific chart or displaying a generic placeholder) if a field is `undefined`. The frontend must never crash due to a missing role-restricted field.

## Rule 17 — Strict Cache Invalidation Strategy
* **The Rule:** TanStack Query (React Query) server state must always remain perfectly synchronized with the backend data. 
* **Implementation:** Every mutation hook (`useMutation`) MUST implement an `onSuccess` callback that calls `queryClient.invalidateQueries({ queryKey: [...] })` for any relevant queries affected by the mutation. Failing to invalidate queries will cause the UI to display stale, obsolete data after an update.

## Rule 18 — Internationalization (i18n) & Localization

### Strategy: Module-Co-located Locales + AI-Generated Translations (Zero External Cost)

The frontend uses `next-intl` (Next.js) with **co-located locale files inside each feature module folder** — NOT in a central `src/messages/` directory. This preserves **Extreme Isolation**: each feature module owns its own strings and can be moved, deleted, or versioned independently.

**Translations are written by the AI agent at the time it writes the module code.** No external API is needed. The AI already has full context of the Gym Management domain, making translations accurate and idiomatic.

### Stack
- **Library:** `next-intl` (Next.js) or `react-i18next` (plain React/Vite)
- **Base language:** English (`en.json`) — written by AI agent when creating the module
- **Other languages:** Written by the AI agent in the same commit
- **Runtime cost:** Zero — all files are static JSON, bundled at build time

### Module-Level File Structure
Each feature module owns its own `_locales/` folder:
```
src/features/
  admin/
    members/
      _locales/
        en.json   ← AI writes this when creating the module
        nl.json   ← AI translates this in the same commit
        fr.json
      components/
      hooks/
  superadmin/
    tenants/
      _locales/
        en.json
        nl.json
scripts/
  merge-locales.ts   ← Merges all _locales into one bundle at build time
```

### `_locales/en.json` (Source of Truth per Module)
```json
{
  "MEMBERS": {
    "PAGE_TITLE": "Members",
    "ADD_MEMBER": "Add Member",
    "EMPTY_STATE": "No members found. Add your first member to get started."
  }
}
```

### AI Agent Translation Rule
When writing a new feature module, the AI MUST:
1. Create `_locales/en.json` with all English UI strings used in the module.
2. In the **same commit**, create `_locales/nl.json`, `_locales/fr.json`, etc. for all configured languages, using its own translation capability.
3. Translations must be **contextually correct** for a Gym Management SaaS.

```json
// _locales/nl.json — AI writes this, context-aware
{
  "MEMBERS": {
    "PAGE_TITLE": "Leden",
    "ADD_MEMBER": "Lid toevoegen",
    "EMPTY_STATE": "Geen leden gevonden. Voeg uw eerste lid toe om te beginnen."
  }
}
```

### Using Translations in Components
Always use the `t()` function — **never** hardcode English strings in JSX:
```tsx
import { useTranslations } from 'next-intl';

export const MembersPage = () => {
  const t = useTranslations('MEMBERS');
  // ❌ BAD: <h1>Members</h1>
  // ✅ GOOD:
  return (
    <>
      <h1>{t('PAGE_TITLE')}</h1>
      <Button>{t('ADD_MEMBER')}</Button>
    </>
  );
};
```

### `scripts/merge-locales.ts` (Build-Time Merge Script)
Merges all module `_locales/` folders into a single bundle per language. Runs automatically at build time.

```typescript
// scripts/merge-locales.ts
// Usage: npx ts-node scripts/merge-locales.ts
import * as fs from 'fs';
import * as path from 'path';
import { globSync } from 'glob';

const OUTPUT_DIR = 'public/locales';
const merged: Record<string, Record<string, any>> = {};

for (const file of globSync('src/features/**/_locales/*.json')) {
  const lang = path.basename(file, '.json');         // 'en', 'nl', etc.
  const content = JSON.parse(fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf-8'));
  merged[lang] = { ...merged[lang], ...content };
}

fs.mkdirSync(OUTPUT_DIR, { recursive: true });
for (const [lang, data] of Object.entries(merged)) {
  fs.writeFileSync(`${OUTPUT_DIR}/${lang}.json`, JSON.stringify(data, null, 2));
  console.log(`✅ Merged ${lang}.json`);
}
```

Add to `package.json`:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "i18n:merge": "npx ts-node scripts/merge-locales.ts",
    "build": "npm run i18n:merge && next build"
  }
}
```

### API Client: `Accept-Language` Header
The central `apiFetch` client MUST attach the current locale to every request:
```typescript
import { getLocale } from 'next-intl/server';

export const apiFetch = async (url: string, options?: RequestInit) => {
  const locale = await getLocale(); // 'nl', 'fr', 'en'
  return fetch(url, {
    ...options,
    headers: { 'Accept-Language': locale, ...options?.headers },
  });
};
```

### Developer Workflow
1. AI writes a new feature module and creates `_locales/en.json`.
2. AI, in the **same response**, creates all target-language `_locales/{lang}.json` files.
3. Run `npm run i18n:merge` (or let CI/build do it automatically).
4. Commit all `_locales/` files alongside the feature module code.
5. **Never** put locale files in a central `src/messages/` or `src/i18n/` folder.

### Configured Target Languages
This is the **authoritative list of languages** this project supports. There is no central config file — this instruction document IS the config. When an AI agent creates any new module, it MUST generate `_locales/` files for every language in this list.

| Code | Language | Region | Script | Priority |
|------|----------|--------|--------|----------|
| `en` | English | Global | Latin | **Base — always first** |
| `nl` | Dutch | Netherlands, Belgium | Latin | High |
| `fr` | French | France, Belgium, Canada | Latin | High |
| `de` | German | Germany, Austria, Switzerland | Latin | High |
| `hi` | Hindi | India (North) | Devanagari | High |
| `mr` | Marathi | Maharashtra, India | Devanagari | Medium |
| `ta` | Tamil | Tamil Nadu, Sri Lanka | Tamil | Medium |
| `te` | Telugu | Andhra Pradesh, Telangana | Telugu | Medium |
| `kn` | Kannada | Karnataka, India | Kannada | Medium |
| `bn` | Bengali | West Bengal, Bangladesh | Bengali | Medium |
| `gu` | Gujarati | Gujarat, India | Gujarati | Low |
| `ml` | Malayalam | Kerala, India | Malayalam | Low |
| `pa` | Punjabi | Punjab, India/Pakistan | Gurmukhi | Low |

> **Phased Rollout:** Do not ship all languages at launch. Start with `en` + `hi` (covers ~40% of India). Add `nl`, `fr`, `de` for European markets. Add remaining Indian regional languages as the product expands into those regions. Update this table when a new language is officially launched.

> **Indian Script Note (Web):** Indian scripts (Devanagari, Tamil, Telugu, etc.) require specific fonts. Use `next/font` to load Google Fonts such as `Noto Sans Devanagari`, `Noto Sans Tamil`, `Noto Sans Telugu` etc. for each script. Load fonts lazily — only load a script font when that locale is active. Never embed all script fonts at initial page load.

> **AI AGENT NOTE:** Every UI string in JSX MUST use `t('NAMESPACE.KEY')`. When creating a new feature module, you MUST create `_locales/en.json` AND all configured target-language files (e.g., `_locales/nl.json`) in the same response. Use your own translation capability — do NOT call external APIs. Hardcoding English strings in JSX is a critical violation.

## Rule 19 — Centralized Feature Flags
* **The Rule:** Never use environment variables (e.g., `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_FEATURE`) directly in JSX logic to conditionally render UI elements. 
* **Implementation:** Application feature flags must be fetched dynamically from the backend at initialization and stored in Context or Zustand. Features should be toggled via a dedicated custom hook (`useFeatureFlag('ENABLE_NEW_BILLING')`). This allows flags to be changed per-tenant or per-user dynamically without needing a frontend deployment.


## Rule 20 — Multi-Currency Monetary Amounts

### The Rule
The backend sends all monetary amounts as **integers in the smallest currency unit** (paise for INR, cents for USD/EUR) alongside an ISO 4217 currency code. The frontend is solely responsible for formatting. Never hardcode a currency symbol or divide raw amounts manually.

### Canonical Formatting Utility
Create ONE shared utility per feature module. All currency display in that module MUST go through this function:
``````typescript
// utils/formatCurrency.ts (co-located inside the feature module)
/**
 * Formats a monetary amount from its smallest unit to a locale-aware display string.
 * @param amount  Integer in smallest unit (e.g., 9999 for ₹99.99)
 * @param currency ISO 4217 currency code (e.g., 'INR', 'USD', 'EUR')
 * @param locale  BCP 47 locale string (e.g., 'en-IN', 'nl-NL', 'en-US')
 */
export const formatCurrency = (
  amount: number,
  currency: string,
  locale: string = 'en-IN'
): string => {
  const subunitMap: Record<string, number> = {
    JPY: 1, KWD: 1000, BHD: 1000, // no subunit or 3-decimal currencies
  };
  const divisor = subunitMap[currency] ?? 100;
  return new Intl.NumberFormat(locale, {
    style: 'currency',
    currency,
    minimumFractionDigits: divisor === 1 ? 0 : 2,
  }).format(amount / divisor);
};

// Usage:
// formatCurrency(9999, 'INR', 'en-IN')  →  '₹99.99'
// formatCurrency(9999, 'USD', 'en-US')  →  '$99.99'
// formatCurrency(9999, 'EUR', 'nl-NL')  →  '€99,99'
// formatCurrency(100,  'JPY', 'ja-JP')  →  '¥100'
``````

### Rules
- ❌ Never do `amount / 100` inline in JSX.
- ❌ Never hardcode `₹`, `$`, or `€` symbols anywhere in JSX or components.
- ❌ Never store the formatted string in state or TanStack Query cache — store the raw integer.
- ✅ Always derive the locale from the active i18n locale (`useLocale()` from `next-intl`).

``````tsx
// ❌ BAD
<Text>₹{plan.amount / 100}</Text>

// ✅ GOOD
import { useLocale } from 'next-intl';
const locale = useLocale();
<Text>{formatCurrency(plan.amount, plan.currency, locale)}</Text>
``````

> **AI AGENT NOTE:** Every time you display a monetary amount, use the module-local `formatCurrency()` utility. The raw integer from the API must never be rendered directly in JSX. The locale MUST come from the active i18n context — never hardcode `'en-IN'`. No currency symbol may appear as a literal string anywhere in JSX.


## Rule 21 — Tenant Data Export & Offboarding UX

### The Rule
Data exports take minutes to process and cannot be downloaded synchronously. The frontend MUST handle the export trigger as an asynchronous background request.

### UI Placement
The export functionality must live in a dedicated, clearly visible section: **Admin Settings -> Data Export & Offboarding**. 
- **Role Constraint:** This UI MUST only be available in the **Superadmin** (or top-level Gym Admin) dashboard. Never add export buttons to manager, trainer, or member interfaces.

### Interaction Flow
1. **Button:** Display a clear `[ Request Full Data Export ]` button.
2. **Action:** When clicked, call the backend `POST /export-data`.
3. **Feedback:** Do NOT show a continuous loading spinner waiting for a file download. Since the API returns `202 Accepted` immediately, show a success toast or alert: 
   *"Export started. You will receive an email with a secure download link within a few minutes."*
4. **Format Expectation:** The UI should explicitly inform the user that their data will be provided as a ZIP file containing easy-to-read Excel (CSV) files.
5. **Real-time Completion Feedback:** The dashboard MUST listen for a WebSocket event (e.g., `export.completed`) or poll a status endpoint. When received, update the UI to confirm: *"Your data export is ready and the email has been sent."*

> **AI AGENT NOTE:** Do not implement a file download stream or blob parsing for the `/export-data` endpoint. The frontend's only responsibility is to trigger the request and show an async confirmation message.


## Notification & WebSocket Recovery Rule

### The Problem
If the user's app is closed or loses internet connection when a WebSocket event is fired from the backend, the event is lost.

### The Rule
The frontend (Web and Mobile) MUST implement a hybrid notification architecture:
1. **Real-time:** Listen to WebSocket events (e.g., `notification.received`) and update the UI (bell icon, toast) immediately if the app is open.
2. **Offline Recovery:** Whenever the application mounts (or comes to the foreground on mobile), it MUST make a REST API call to `GET /api/notifications` to fetch any missed notifications. Do not rely 100% on WebSockets for critical alerts.
